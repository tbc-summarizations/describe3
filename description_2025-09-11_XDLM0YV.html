  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of Kazakhstan's national team performances across these matches and competitions:

<strong>Individual Match Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Friendly Matches:</strong>
•   Namibia 0-2 Kazakhstan: 5/10. It's Namibia... a win is expected, but 2-0 isn't exactly dominant.
•   Kazakhstan 2-0 Sudan: 5/10. Again, a must-win. Nothing special.
•   El Salvador 1-4 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Finally, a convincing performance against a slightly better opponent.
•   Kazakhstan 2-0 Niger: 5/10. Should be winning these without much trouble.

•   <strong>UEFA Nations League C:</strong>
•   Azerbaijan 0-2 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Solid away win to start the campaign.
•   Kazakhstan 3-1 Montenegro: 8/10. Montenegro is a decent team, so this is a great result.
•   Kazakhstan 2-1 Latvia: 6/10. Close game against a weaker side. Could have been better.
•   Kazakhstan 6-1 Azerbaijan: 9/10. Utter domination. Can't ask for much more.
•   Montenegro 1-2 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Another good win away from home against a solid team.
•   Latvia 0-3 Kazakhstan: 8/10. Comprehensive victory to seal promotion.

•   <strong>UEFA European Championship Qualifiers:</strong>
•   Kazakhstan 0-1 Albania: 3/10. Disappointing home loss to a direct competitor.
•   Kazakhstan 0-2 Poland: 2/10. Expected loss, but still a poor showing at home.
•   Serbia 1-1 Kazakhstan: 5/10. A decent point away, but not enough to change the trajectory.
•   Kazakhstan 0-1 Italy: 3/10. Another expected loss. Did little to trouble Italy.
•   Kazakhstan 2-0 Slovenia: 7/10. Good win at home, but probably too late to impact qualification.
•   Albania 1-0 Kazakhstan: 3/10. Another loss to Albania. Qualification hopes ended.
•   Poland 0-0 Kazakhstan: 5/10. Good defensive effort but lacking attacking ambition.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Serbia: 7/10. Good win, even if it did come against a struggling Serbia side.
•   Italy 0-0 Kazakhstan: 6/10. A solid defensive performance, securing an unexpected point.
•   Slovenia 0-0 Kazakhstan: 6/10. Another decent point away, but draws are killing them.

•   <strong>FIFA World Cup Qualifiers:</strong>
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Turkey: 8/10. Massive win to start the campaign!
•   Iceland 0-1 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Another great away win!
•   Slovakia 0-1 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Three wins in a row! Surprising everyone.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Russia: 8/10. Unbelievable! Top of the group!
•   Belgium 2-0 Kazakhstan: 5/10. Reality check. Expected loss.
•   Turkey 3-1 Kazakhstan: 4/10. Lost momentum.
•   Kazakhstan 1-1 Iceland: 5/10. Point at home is not enough.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Slovakia: 7/10. Back on track.
•   Russia 1-2 Kazakhstan: 8/10. Qualified to play-off spot after stunning win.
•   Kazakhstan 0-1 Belgium: 3/10. End of the qualification hopes.

•   <strong>Play-offs:</strong>
•   Austria 2-0 Kazakhstan: 2/10. Poor showing away. No chance to qualify.
•   Kazakhstan 1-1 Austria: 5/10. A draw at home isn't enough. End of road.

<strong>Competition Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Friendly Matches:</strong> 5/10. Did what they should do against weaker opposition. Nothing impressive.
•   <strong>UEFA Nations League C:</strong> 9/10. Perfect record, promotion achieved. Excellent performance.
•   <strong>UEFA European Championship Qualifiers:</strong> 4/10. Failed to qualify, some decent results, but ultimately disappointing.
•   <strong>FIFA World Cup Qualifiers:</strong> 7/10. Qualified for the play-off. Impressive group-stage performance but failed to go through in play-off round.

<strong>Overall Performance:</strong>

Overall Rating: <strong>6/10</strong>.

Here's the reasoning:

•   The Nations League performance was exceptional and significantly boosts the overall rating.
•   The World Cup Qualifying campaign was also impressive.
•   However, the Euro qualifying campaign was a letdown, and the friendly matches were largely unremarkable.
•   While they showed flashes of brilliance, Kazakhstan needs to be more consistent against tougher opponents and avoid slip-ups against weaker teams. The play-off round performance was really below average.

They demonstrated progress and potential, but haven't yet reached the level to compete consistently at the highest level in Europe.</div>
