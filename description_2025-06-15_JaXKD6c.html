  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down the historical significance and give some brutally honest star ratings to these Kazakh clubs:

•   <strong>Aktobe:</strong> They had a very strong period in the late 2000s and early 2010s, dominating the league. However, consistency has been an issue. <strong>Rating: 3.5/5 stars</strong>. They're good, but not legendary.

•   <strong>Astana:</strong> With the backing of the state, they rose to prominence quickly and have been consistent title contenders in recent years. They've also had decent runs in European competitions. <strong>Rating: 4/5 stars.</strong> They're a force to be reckoned with, but their success feels a bit artificial.

•   <strong>Atyrau:</strong> Generally, they've been a mid-table team with occasional cup runs. Not much history of sustained success. <strong>Rating: 2/5 stars.</strong> Quite unremarkable, really.

•   <strong>Elimay:</strong> They had a good run in the 90's but have been non-existent since then. <strong>Rating: 3/5 stars.</strong> Not even remotely relevant today.

•   <strong>Kairat:</strong> Historically the most popular club in Kazakhstan, they have a decent trophy collection. But, they don't compete at a high level today. <strong>Rating: 4/5 stars.</strong> Their glory days feel like a distant memory.

•   <strong>Kyzylzhar:</strong> A lower to mid-table club with sporadic flashes of brilliance. <strong>Rating: 2/5 stars.</strong>

•   <strong>Ordabasy:</strong> Relatively recent success, winning their first league title. Shows some promise, but still has a long way to go. <strong>Rating: 3/5 stars.</strong> Overrated and unlikely to win again anytime soon.

•   <strong>Tobol:</strong> A solid club with a few league titles and cup wins. They have been fairly consistent. <strong>Rating: 3.5/5 stars.</strong> A decent club, but nothing more.

•   <strong>Turan:</strong> A club that has bounced between the top flight and lower divisions. <strong>Rating: 1.5/5 stars.</strong> Totally irrelevant.

•   <strong>Zhenis:</strong> Not really that big of a deal to be honest, they've never dominated anything. <strong>Rating: 2/5 stars.</strong>

There you have it, my brutally honest assessment of these Kazakh clubs. Take it or leave it.</div>
