  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of Kazakhstan's national team performances:

<strong>Individual Match Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Friendly:</strong>
•   Kazakhstan 1-1 Libya: 4/10 - Uninspiring draw against a weak opponent.
•   Vietnam 1-0 Kazakhstan: 2/10 - Embarrassing loss to a team they should beat.
•   Kazakhstan 3-0 Guinea-Bissau: 6/10 - Decent win, but Guinea-Bissau is hardly a benchmark.
•   Niger 0-0 Kazakhstan: 3/10 - Another dull draw.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Cyprus: 5/10 - A narrow win against a fellow minnow.

•   <strong>UEFA Nations League B:</strong>
•   Kazakhstan 0-0 Bosnia: 5/10 - A lucky draw, Bosnia was clearly the better team.
•   Scotland 2-1 Kazakhstan: 4/10 - Predictable loss, showed little fight.
•   Norway 4-0 Kazakhstan: 1/10 - Utter humiliation, completely outclassed.
•   Bosnia 1-1 Kazakhstan: 4/10 - Another undeserved draw.
•   Kazakhstan 5-1 Scotland: 9/10 - A massive upset, incredible performance.
•   Kazakhstan 2-2 Norway: 6/10 - Decent result, but Norway likely took their foot off the gas.

•   <strong>UEFA European Championship Qualifiers:</strong>
•   Kazakhstan 1-2 Hungary: 4/10 - Disappointing home loss.
•   Sweden 0-1 Kazakhstan: 8/10 - Huge shock win against a strong team.
•   Belarus 1-1 Kazakhstan: 5/10 - Acceptable away draw.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Bosnia: 6/10 - Solid win, but Bosnia was in decline.
•   Germany 3-1 Kazakhstan: 3/10 - Expected loss, but could have been worse.
•   Hungary 0-0 Kazakhstan: 5/10 - Decent away point.
•   Kazakhstan 0-0 Sweden: 4/10 - Lucky to get a point, Sweden dominated.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Belarus: 6/10 - Necessary win against a weak opponent.
•   Bosnia 2-0 Kazakhstan: 3/10 - Back to reality, a poor loss.
•   Kazakhstan 0-1 Germany: 2/10 - Showed no ambition, just parked the bus.

•   <strong>FIFA World Cup Qualifiers:</strong>
•   Kazakhstan 0-1 Serbia: 3/10 - Close loss, but never looked like winning.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Slovenia: 5/10 - Scrappy win, not convincing.
•   Sweden 2-1 Kazakhstan: 4/10 - Predictable loss, fought a little.
•   Kazakhstan 0-2 Spain: 1/10 - Complete dominance by Spain, embarrassing.
•   Kazakhstan 0-2 Northern Ireland: 2/10 - Shockingly bad, Northern Ireland is nothing special.
•   Serbia 3-0 Kazakhstan: 1/10 - Annihilation, showed no resistance.
•   Slovenia 1-1 Kazakhstan: 4/10 - Lucky draw, Slovenia should have won easily.
•   Kazakhstan 0-2 Sweden: 2/10 - Played scared, never threatened.
•   Spain 2-1 Kazakhstan: 3/10 - Spain was clearly the better team.
•   Northern Ireland 0-1 Kazakhstan: 6/10 - Good win, but Northern Ireland is a weak team at the moment.

<strong>Competition Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Friendly Matches:</strong> 3/10 - Inconsistent, mostly against weak opposition, and some embarrassing results.
•   <strong>UEFA Nations League B:</strong> 5/10 - Mixed bag, one incredible win, but also some heavy defeats. Barely managed to stay in League B.
•   <strong>UEFA European Championship Qualifiers:</strong> 4/10 - Occasional upsets, but ultimately failed to qualify and showed inconsistency.
•   <strong>FIFA World Cup Qualifiers:</strong> 2/10 - Abysmal performance, lots of heavy losses and little fight.

<strong>Overall Performance:</strong>

Kazakhstan's overall performance is a dismal <strong>3/10</strong>. They are a team of occasional upsets surrounded by mediocrity and embarrassing defeats. They lack consistency, tactical discipline, and the quality to compete at a higher level. Their occasional good results are flukes rather than signs of genuine improvement.</div>
