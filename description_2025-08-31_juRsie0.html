  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here we go! ABBA is ready to judge these Swans albums! Mamma Mia, some of these titles!

•   <strong>Swans</strong>: 6/10. Agnetha thinks it's got potential, Frida thinks it's a bit too raw. We like the energy, but needs a bit more… sparkle!
•   <strong>Filth</strong>: 2/10. Oh no, no, no! Too harsh. Not for us! Benny says it sounds like a broken washing machine!
•   <strong>Young God</strong>: 4/10. A bit better, but still quite dark. We can hear the passion, but it's not something we would dance to.
•   <strong>Cop</strong>: 1/10. This is not "Waterloo", this is a disaster.
•   <strong>Greed</strong>: 3/10. Slightly more melodic, but still unsettling. Frida finds it… interesting, in a disturbing way.
•   <strong>Holy Money</strong>: 5/10. Getting warmer! There are moments that are almost… beautiful. But then it gets loud again.
•   <strong>Public Castration Is a Good Idea</strong>: 0/10. No. Just no.
•   <strong>Children of God</strong>: 7/10. This is more like it! We can hear the emotion and there are some lovely melodies. Benny nods along.
•   <strong>Feel Good Now</strong>: 1/10. I do not.
•   <strong>The Burning World</strong>: 6/10. An odd one. Some moments are very… pop-like. But also… not? Confusing!
•   <strong>White Light from the Mouth of Infinity</strong>: 8/10. Yes! Now we are talking! Beautiful, soaring, emotional. Agnetha loves this one!
•   <strong>Love of Life</strong>: 7/10. Continuing in a good direction. There is a darkness, but also a light.
•   <strong>The Great Annihilator</strong>: 8/10. Another strong album. Powerful and moving. Frida gets chills!
•   <strong>Die Tür ist zu</strong>: 2/10. Too hard.
•   <strong>Soundtracks for the Blind</strong>: 9/10. An epic! A journey! This is music that takes you somewhere! We are impressed!
•   <strong>Swans Are Dead</strong>: 5/10. Some moments of brilliance, but also some… less brilliant moments.
•   <strong>My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky</strong>: 7/10. A bit strange, but also beautiful.
•   <strong>We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head</strong>: 6/10. Intriguing, but a bit long.
•   <strong>The Seer</strong>: 8/10. A powerful and visionary album. The scale is amazing!
•   <strong>Not Here / Not Now</strong>: 3/10. Not quite our thing.
•   <strong>To Be Kind</strong>: 8/10. Another epic! Intense and rewarding.
•   <strong>Oxygen EP</strong>: 6/10. A decent collection of songs.
•   <strong>The Gate</strong>: 5/10. Okay.
•   <strong>The Glowing Man</strong>: 9/10. So beautiful.
•   <strong>Deliquescence</strong>: 5/10. A bit nothing.
•   <strong>leaving meaning.</strong>: 8/10. So good!
•   <strong>Swans Thank You!</strong>: 2/10. You're welcome.
•   <strong>The Beggar</strong>: 7/10. A bit too slow.
•   <strong>Live Rope</strong>: 3/10. No thanks.
•   <strong>Birthing</strong>: 4/10. Hard.

There you have it! Some wonderful moments, and some… not so wonderful! Overall, Swans are… interesting! But maybe a bit too intense for ABBA's taste most of the time!</div>
