  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this knockout stage, no holds barred.

<strong>Round of 16: Initial Impressions</strong>

•   <strong>Croatia vs. Bulgaria:</strong> A workmanlike performance from Croatia. Kramarić continues to be a consistent threat, and Petković adding another late goal is a good sign of their squad depth. Bulgaria, frankly, offered little resistance.

•   <strong>Greece vs. Slovakia:</strong> Greece's decline continues. They were thoroughly outclassed by a dynamic Slovakian side. Suslov and Strelec exposed their defensive frailties. This confirms that Greece has been relying on the past for too long.

•   <strong>Serbia vs. Albania:</strong> This was always going to be a tense affair. Serbia showed their quality, but Albania managed to get a goal back, making it a closer game than Serbia would have liked. Albania, despite the loss, will see this as a respectable performance given the political undertones.

•   <strong>Romania vs. Slovenia:</strong> Romania showed some grit and composure to defeat Slovenia. Pușcaș and Man are exciting attacking players and are probably ready to join a bigger club. Slovenia's late goal from Stojanović was just a consolation.

•   <strong>Hungary vs. Bosnia:</strong> A tight game decided by Gazdag's late goal. Hungary continues to impress as a well-organized and disciplined team. Bosnia were too reliant on individual moments of brilliance, which never materialized.

•   <strong>Poland vs. Georgia:</strong> Poland got the job done, but they were far from convincing. Lewandowski getting on the scoresheet is always vital, but they conceded against Georgia, which is worrying. Georgia, despite the loss, showed some attacking promise, especially through Davitashvili.

•   <strong>Belarus vs. North Macedonia:</strong> A dire match that was settled by a single goal. North Macedonia will be happy to progress, but this was a very low-quality match. Belarus continues to struggle.

•   <strong>Ukraine vs. Turkey:</strong> The most thrilling match of the round! Turkey were dominant from the beginning. Çalhanoğlu's extra-time goal sealed the win. Ukraine's Yarmolenko getting a goal is a positive, but they need more consistency.

<strong>Quarter-finals: The Stakes Rise</strong>

•   <strong>Croatia vs. Slovakia:</strong> Croatia were tested by Slovakia. Slovakia's Ondrej Duda briefly leveled the score. Kramarić ultimately secured the win for Croatia. Croatia is starting to look like a serious contender.

•   <strong>Serbia vs. Romania:</strong> A comfortable win for Serbia. Mitrović continues to be the key player. Romania were simply outmatched.

•   <strong>Hungary vs. Poland:</strong> Hungary continues their impressive run, defeating Poland. Hungary is becoming the dark horse of the tournament.

•   <strong>North Macedonia vs. Turkey:</strong> The surprise of the round! North Macedonia eliminates Turkey with a clinical performance. Turkey, despite their talent, failed to perform when it mattered. This result is an embarrassment for Turkish football.

<strong>Semi-finals: The Final Two Emerge</strong>

•   <strong>Croatia vs. Serbia:</strong> A highly charged and intense match. Croatia were able to overcome Serbia. Kramarić's goal proved to be decisive. This match was a classic, filled with drama and emotion.

•   <strong>Hungary vs. North Macedonia:</strong> Hungary dominated this match. Nagy's two goals set the tone, and Szoboszlai added the final touch. North Macedonia's Cinderella story ends here.

<strong>The Final: Croatia vs. Hungary</strong>

This final is a clash of styles and experience. Croatia's seasoned squad, led by the likes of Perišić and Kramarić, will be difficult to break down. Their midfield is composed and creative, and they have the experience of playing in high-pressure situations. However, Hungary is the surprise package of the tournament. Their organized defense, combined with a dynamic attack led by Szoboszlai and Sallai, makes them a dangerous opponent.

<strong>Prediction:</strong>

While Hungary has been impressive, Croatia's experience and quality will see them through. I'm predicting a <strong>2-1 victory for Croatia</strong>. They have the experience and the determination to lift the trophy. Hungary will put up a good fight, but ultimately, Croatia's superior quality will prevail.

<strong>Biggest Surprises:</strong>

1.  <strong>North Macedonia Eliminating Turkey:</strong> An absolute shocker. Turkey was expected to go far in this tournament, but North Macedonia exposed their weaknesses and took their chance.
2.  <strong>Hungary's Dominance:</strong> Nobody expected Hungary to reach the final. Their organized play and tactical discipline have been a revelation.

<strong>Biggest Disappointments:</strong>

1.  <strong>Turkey:</strong> A massive underachievement. Their squad is filled with talented players, but they failed to perform consistently and were deservedly eliminated.
2.  <strong>Greece:</strong> Their decline continues. They were outclassed by Slovakia and showed no signs of improvement.

There you have it. No sugarcoating, just pure, unadulterated analysis. This knockout stage has been full of surprises, disappointments, and moments of brilliance. The final promises to be a thrilling encounter.</div>
