  <h1>Description for 250px-FC_Copenhagen_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Copenhagen starting XI with the brutal honesty you demanded.

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Dominik Kotarski:</strong> 6/10. Solid shot-stopper, but lacks the commanding presence and distribution skills of a top-tier keeper. Still young, but needs to show significant improvement to be considered elite.

•   <strong>Marcos López:</strong> 5/10. Energetic, but defensively suspect. Prone to lapses in concentration and often caught out of position. Offers limited attacking threat.

•   <strong>Gabriel Pereira:</strong> 5/10. Lacks the physical presence and aerial ability needed to dominate opposing strikers. A weak link in the backline.

•   <strong>Pantelis Hatzidiakos:</strong> 6/10. Decent defender, but inconsistent. Can be prone to rash challenges and lacks the pace to recover from mistakes. Not a leader.

•   <strong>Rodrigo Huescas:</strong> 5/10. Lacks the defensive discipline and tactical awareness required to thrive at a high level. Often struggles against pacey wingers.

•   <strong>Magnus Mattsson:</strong> 7/10. Creative midfielder with a good eye for a pass. Lacks the physicality to dominate in midfield. Can be a liability defensively.

•   <strong>Lukas Lerager:</strong> 7/10. Hard-working midfielder with a decent engine. Lacks the technical ability and vision to dictate play. A functional player, but not a game-changer.

•   <strong>Thomas Delaney:</strong> 8/10. Experienced and reliable midfielder with a good understanding of the game. Lacks the pace and agility of his younger self. Can still offer valuable leadership and defensive solidity.

•   <strong>Elias Achouri:</strong> 6/10. Tricky winger with flashes of brilliance. Lacks consistency and end product. Often disappears in big games.

•   <strong>Youssoufa Moukoko:</strong> 8/10. Talented striker with a keen eye for goal. Lacks the physical presence and aerial ability to be a complete forward. Can be a frustrating player to watch due to inconsistency.

•   <strong>Mohamed Elyounoussi:</strong> 7/10. Experienced winger with a decent goal-scoring record. Lacks the pace and agility to beat defenders consistently. A reliable player, but not a match-winner.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6/10</strong>

This Copenhagen starting XI is a mixed bag of talent and mediocrity. The midfield is solid but lacks creativity, while the attack is reliant on individual brilliance rather than cohesive teamwork. The defense is the weakest link, with several players who lack the quality to compete at a high level. Overall, this team lacks the balance and quality needed to challenge for major honors. They might be competitive, but they're not title contenders with this lineup.</div>
