  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this fictional player's career with the honesty you demanded.

<strong>Overall Career Rating: 7.5/10</strong>

Here's the breakdown by club:

•   <strong>Palestino (2024-2025): 6/10</strong> A decent start, but nothing exceptional. Showing promise, but needs to prove himself. 15 appearances with 4 goals and 3 assists is a decent start for a 16 year old, however, it's nothing impressive.

•   <strong>Beşiktaş (2025-2030): 8/10</strong> This is where he made a name for himself. Solid numbers in a competitive league. 70 goals and 37 assists in 199 appearances is great for a teenager/young adult. A Turkish Cup win is a good accomplishment.

•   <strong>Chelsea (2030-2041): 8.5/10</strong> His peak years. Over 500 appearances shows his importance to the team. While his goalscoring rate dropped a bit, he remained a consistent performer. The Europa League, Conference League and FA Cup victories add significant weight to his legacy. The statistics of 159 goals and 95 assists in 505 appearances is very average for Chelsea.

•   <strong>MTK Budapest (2041-2045): 7/10</strong> A good late-career move. Scoring a ton of goals in Hungary, but the league isn't as competitive as the others he played in. Still, leading MTK to a domestic treble shows he remained a valuable player. 86 goals and 34 assists in 122 appearances is pretty good and he could've still been able to play at a higher level in a better league.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

His international record is excellent – 75 goals in 149 appearances. However, the fact that he never won a major international trophy holds him back from being considered truly world-class.

Ultimately, he was a very good player, but not quite an all-time great. Winning more major trophies with Chelsea would have elevated him to a higher level. His later career in Hungary, while statistically impressive, doesn't add much to his legacy due to the league's lower quality.</div>
