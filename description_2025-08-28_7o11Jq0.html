  <h1>Description for 250px-UEFA_Europa_League_2024.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here’s my brutally honest take on each team's chances of winning the 2025-26 UEFA Europa League:

•   <strong>Roma 🇮🇹:</strong> 15% - They've got the history and the Mourinho factor. But their squad depth is questionable, and they tend to choke under pressure.

•   <strong>Porto 🇵🇹:</strong> 12% - Always a tough out, but they lack the star power to go all the way. Their defense is solid, but goals will be a problem.

•   <strong>Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 3% - They're gritty and passionate, but lack the quality to compete with the top teams. A good run to the quarters would be a success.

•   <strong>Feyenoord 🇳🇱:</strong> 8% - They’re decent in the Eredivisie, but the Europa League is a different beast. A plucky underdog, but unlikely to win it.

•   <strong>Lille 🇫🇷:</strong> 7% - Can be exciting on their day, but inconsistent. They're too reliant on individual brilliance.

•   <strong>Dinamo Zagreb 🇭🇷:</strong> 1% - A plucky team, but let's be real, they're just happy to be there.

•   <strong>Real Betis 🇪🇸:</strong> 6% - Can play attractive football, but they lack the killer instinct to win a major trophy.

•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg 🇦🇹:</strong> 5% - Good for developing talent, but they always get picked apart by bigger clubs before they can truly contend.

•   <strong>Aston Villa 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 18% - They're on the rise, and could be a dark horse. But their inexperience in Europe could be a downfall.

•   <strong>Fenerbahçe 🇹🇷:</strong> 4% - Passionate fans, but the team is often a mess. Too many egos, not enough teamwork.

•   <strong>Braga 🇵🇹:</strong> 2% - A decent Portuguese side, but they're not going to win the whole thing.

•   <strong>Red Star Belgrade 🇷🇸:</strong> 0.1% - No chance. Let's be real.

•   <strong>Lyon 🇫🇷:</strong> 10% - Historically strong, but they've fallen off. Need a major overhaul to compete again.

•   <strong>PAOK 🇬🇷:</strong> 0.5% - A tough place to go, but not a team that strikes fear into the hearts of Europe's elite.

•   <strong>Viktoria Plzeň 🇨🇿:</strong> 0.01% - Zero chance.

•   <strong>Ferencváros 🇭🇺:</strong> 0.01% - Nope.

•   <strong>Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 2% - Loud fans, but that's about it.

•   <strong>Maccabi Tel Aviv 🇮🇱:</strong> 0.01% - Not a chance.

•   <strong>Young Boys 🇨🇭:</strong> 0.01% - Zero chance.

•   <strong>Basel 🇨🇭:</strong> 0.01% - Seriously?

•   <strong>Midtjylland 🇩🇰:</strong> 0.01% - Absolutely not.

•   <strong>SC Freiburg 🇩🇪:</strong> 9% - Well-coached, but lack the star power to go the distance. A solid team, but not a winner.

•   <strong>Ludogorets 🇧🇬:</strong> 0.01% - No way.

•   <strong>Nottingham Forest 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 6% - Could surprise people, but they're still building. Too unpredictable.

•   <strong>Sturm Graz 🇦🇹:</strong> 0.01% - Don't make me laugh.

•   <strong>FCSB 🇷🇴:</strong> 0.01% - No chance.

•   <strong>Nice 🇫🇷:</strong> 4% - Inconsistent and prone to collapses.

•   <strong>Bologna 🇮🇹:</strong> 3% - Overachieving, but lack the experience.

•   <strong>Celta Vigo 🇪🇸:</strong> 2% - Average Spanish side.

•   <strong>VfB Stuttgart 🇩🇪:</strong> 5% - Unreliable.

•   <strong>Panathinaikos 🇬🇷:</strong> 0.01% - Nope.

•   <strong>Malmö 🇸🇪:</strong> 0.01% - Zero.

•   <strong>Go Ahead Eagles 🇳🇱:</strong> 0.01% - Get real.

•   <strong>Utrecht 🇳🇱:</strong> 0.01% - Absolutely zero.

•   <strong>Genk 🇧🇪:</strong> 0.01% - Hahahahaha.

•   <strong>Brann 🇳🇴:</strong> 0.01% - Keep dreaming.

There you have it. Cold, hard, and brutally honest.</div>
