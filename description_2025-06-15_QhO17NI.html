  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of those footballers:

•   <strong>Harry Kane 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Kane is a world-class striker. He's got an incredible goal-scoring record, excellent technique, and is a leader on the pitch. Easy 5 stars.
•   <strong>Georges Mikautadze 🇬🇪:</strong> ⭐⭐ - He's had a decent run with some clubs but isn't great. A two-star player.
•   <strong>Jamal Musiala 🇩🇪:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Musiala is a hugely promising talent. He's got amazing dribbling skills, great vision, and is quickly becoming a key player for Germany. He's not quite reached the absolute top level yet, so 4 stars for now.
•   <strong>Cody Gakpo 🇳🇱:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐ - He shows flashes of brilliance, with good pace and a decent shot. A solid player.
•   <strong>Ivan Schranz 🇸🇰:</strong> ⭐⭐ - He scored against Belgium. But honestly, he's far from elite. He's not someone who consistently dominates matches.
•   <strong>Dani Olmo 🇪🇸:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐ - Olmo is a technically gifted player with good passing and movement. He's a good team player but not a superstar.</div>
