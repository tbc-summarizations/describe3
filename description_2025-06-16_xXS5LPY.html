  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Champions League "Team of the Season" with the cold, hard honesty it deserves:

<strong>Individual Ratings and Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Gianluigi Donnarumma (6/10):</strong> A highly inconsistent keeper, prone to costly errors. His shot-stopping can be brilliant, but his command of the area and decision-making are frequently suspect. He is nothing special.

•   <strong>Achraf Hakimi (8/10):</strong> A dynamic wing-back with exceptional pace and attacking flair. His defensive awareness, however, remains a significant weakness. Hakimi is amazing.

•   <strong>Marquinhos (7/10):</strong> A decent central defender with good leadership qualities, but he's prone to lapses in concentration and can be outmuscled by stronger forwards. Overrated, but reliable enough.

•   <strong>Alessandro Bastoni (8/10):</strong> A composed and technically gifted defender with excellent passing range. His aerial presence and physicality could be improved. An important piece of this team.

•   <strong>Nuno Mendes (7/10):</strong> A promising left-back with great energy and dribbling skills. His defensive positioning and decision-making require further refinement.

•   <strong>Vitinha (5/10):</strong> An okay midfielder with decent passing ability, but he lacks the physicality, vision, and tactical discipline required to dominate in midfield. He is the weak link.

•   <strong>Declan Rice (8/10):</strong> A defensively solid and tactically intelligent midfielder. A superb player but can struggle against teams that press relentlessly and deny him space to operate.

•   <strong>Lamine Yamal (7/10):</strong> A young and exciting winger with bags of potential, but still raw and inexperienced at the highest level. I don't think he will be one of the greats.

•   <strong>Désiré Doué (6/10):</strong> Another one who has decent dribbling skills, but his finishing and overall impact are often underwhelming.

•   <strong>Ousmane Dembélé (6/10):</strong> Incredibly inconsistent and injury-prone. On his day, he can be unplayable, but those days are few and far between. A frustrating player to watch.

•   <strong>Raphinha (7/10):</strong> A skilled winger with a good work rate and decent goal-scoring record, but he lacks the killer instinct and consistency to be a top-tier attacker. Still he is great in his own right.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6/10</strong>

<strong>Champions League Performance Prediction:</strong>

This team is a mess. Despite having great players, this team has way too many holes. They would make it out of the group stage, but they would be dismantled by the quarters for sure.</div>
