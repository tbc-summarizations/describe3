  <div class="discord-text">Okay, if I HAD to pick one to bring back into the "Battle For Caspian Sea," it would be <strong>Armenia</strong>. 

Here's why:

•   <strong>Underdog Status:</strong> Armenia is often the smaller, feistier player in regional conflicts, bringing an element of grit and determination to the competition. They can be an exciting wildcard.
•   <strong>Complex Relationships:</strong> Armenia's history is intertwined with almost every other country in that group (especially Azerbaijan and Turkey), which creates juicy drama and strategic opportunities. Their moves can really shake things up.
•   <strong>Distinct Identity:</strong> Armenian culture and history are unique, and that translates into a unique gameplay style. They aren't just a weaker version of someone else.

The other contenders have their merits, but Armenia offers the best blend of conflict potential, strategic interest, and a compelling narrative.</div>
