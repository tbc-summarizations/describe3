  <h1>Description for 10625.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of Qarabag's attacking options, player by player, and then a rating for the attacking unit as a whole:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Kady Borges ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·:</strong> 6/10. He's got some flashes of skill, but he's frustratingly inconsistent. He can dribble past defenders, but his final product often lets him down. His decision-making in the final third is questionable, and he disappears in big games. A decent squad player, but not a game-changer.

â€¢   <strong>Joni Montiel ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸:</strong> 4/10. A huge disappointment. Expected to bring some creativity and flair, but looks completely lost on the pitch. Lacks the physicality needed for the Azerbaijan league and offers little in terms of goals or assists. Probably a bad signing.

â€¢   <strong>Abdellah Zoubir ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·:</strong> 7/10. One of their better players. He's got pace, can take on defenders, and can score the odd goal. However, he can also be selfish and his crossing is wildly inconsistent. A decent player, but far from world-class.

â€¢   <strong>Leandro Andrade ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡»:</strong> 5/10. Looks promising physically and has some decent technical ability, but he doesn't seem to have a clear role in the team. He drifts in and out of games, and you often forget he's on the pitch. Needs to find some consistency and a defined position.

â€¢   <strong>Oleksiy Kashchuk ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦:</strong> 3/10. Slow, clumsy, has a poor first touch, and looks completely out of his depth. A waste of space on the pitch.

â€¢   <strong>Emmanuel Addai ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­:</strong> 2/10. Offers absolutely nothing. He's slow, weak, technically limited, and doesn't seem to have any footballing intelligence. Should be nowhere near the first team.

â€¢   <strong>Nariman Akhundzada ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿:</strong> 4/10. The young local players is still very raw and is more of a project than a genuine first-team option.

â€¢   <strong>Musa Qurbanly ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿:</strong> 5/10. The young players shows some potential, he's raw and makes a lot of poor decisions.

<strong>Overall Attacking Unit Rating:</strong>

<strong>4/10</strong>. Qarabag's attack is massively underwhelming. They lack a genuine goalscorer, and the creativity in the final third is almost non-existent. They rely far too much on individual moments of brilliance rather than having a coherent attacking plan. Their finishing is atrocious, and they struggle to break down well-organized defenses. Unless they make some serious improvements, they will never go far in Europe. They need a major overhaul of their attacking options.</div>
