  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest attempt at building a somewhat cohesive XI from these nations, keeping in mind the obvious limitations and significant drop-off in quality we're dealing with.

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3 (A VERY Defensive-Minded 4-3-3)</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: Giorgi Mamardashvili (Georgia)</strong> - This is the only truly world-class player on this list. He's athletic, makes incredible saves, and is actually playing in La Liga. No debate here.

•   <strong>Right Back: Konstantinos Tsimikas (Greece)</strong> - He has played for Liverpool and will hopefully put his experience and talent in use.

•   <strong>Center Back: Guram Kashia (Georgia)</strong> - Veteran presence, captain material. He's the least bad of available options.

•   <strong>Center Back: Sotirios Alexandropoulos (Greece)</strong> - He is able to intercept the ball well.

•   <strong>Left Back: Erkin Tapalov (Kazakhstan)</strong> - He's not great but better than the alternatives.

•   <strong>Defensive Midfield: Vladyslav Vasilyev (Kazakhstan)</strong> - Purely a defensive shield. Tackles, fouls, clearances.

•   <strong>Central Midfield: Giorgi Chakvetadze (Georgia)</strong> - Needs to be creative and drive the ball forward. 

•   <strong>Central Midfield: Gerson Rodrigues (Luxembourg)</strong> - I'm assuming we need some goals somehow. Rodrigues has a bit of flair and can at least hit a decent shot.

•   <strong>Right Wing: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Georgia)</strong> - Must be on the list.

•   <strong>Striker: Efthymios Koulouris (Greece)</strong> - Probably the most viable striker from the bunch.

•   <strong>Left Wing: Alessio Curci (Luxembourg)</strong> - Alessio can hopefully get some goals in.

<strong>Tactical Notes and Brutal Truths:</strong>

•   <strong>Defense is Key:</strong> This team would be parking the bus. End of discussion. Any attacking ambition would need to be carefully weighed against the inevitable defensive collapses.

•   <strong>Kvaratskhelia is Carrying:</strong> He is the ONLY reason any opponent would remotely worry. Everything goes through him.

•   <strong>Midfield is a Disaster:</strong> The midfield lacks genuine playmakers, consistent passers, and any real bite. Prepare for getting overrun.

•   <strong>Hope for Set Pieces:</strong> Desperate times call for desperate measures. Free kicks and corners are this team's best chance to score.

This lineup is, bluntly, not good. It's built on individual moments of brilliance from Kvaratskhelia and Mamardashvili, and a desperate hope that the defensive players can somehow hold on for dear life. Expect a lot of 1-0 losses, 0-0 draws against equally terrible opposition, and the occasional embarrassing blowout.

If you were managing this team, you'd be praying for rain.</div>
