  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my take on these Car Seat Headrest albums, like I'm Imagine Dragons. Get ready for some real talk:

1.  <strong>Sunburned Shirts:</strong> 3/10. A bit too lo-fi for our stadium sound. Needs more epic build-ups.

2.  <strong>My Back Is Killing Me Baby:</strong> 4/10. I respect the raw emotion, but it's just too much of a downer. Where's the anthemic energy?

3.  <strong>Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror):</strong> 5/10. It's got a certain charm, but the production is rough. Needs a serious glow-up in the studio.

4.  <strong>Monomania:</strong> 6/10. I can appreciate the darker themes, but it lacks a certain polish. Needs a bigger sound.

5.  <strong>Starving While Living:</strong> 3/10. I'm not loving the production or energy. It's just not for me, sorry.

6.  <strong>Nervous Young Man:</strong> 5/10. It's got a story, but the execution falls short. Where's the soaring vocals and dramatic instrumentation?

7.  <strong>How To Leave Town:</strong> 4/10. Too experimental and disjointed for our taste. Needs more focus and structure.

8.  <strong>Teens of Style:</strong> 7/10. Now we're talking! Catchy hooks and a tighter sound. Still needs some work, but it's on the right track.

9.  <strong>Teens of Denial:</strong> 8/10. Solid songwriting and more polished production. I can actually see myself enjoying this one.

10. <strong>Twin Fantasy (Face to Face):</strong> 6/10. I'm not a huge fan, not really anything I would play for enjoyment

11. <strong>Making a Door Less Open:</strong> 5/10. Eh, a bit too weird for us. Needs more accessible melodies and sing-along choruses.

12. <strong>MADLO: Influences:</strong> 4/10. Too derivative and uninspired. Needs more originality and experimentation.

13. <strong>The Scholars:</strong> 2/10. Absolutely the worst piece of crap I have ever heard.

There you have it. Brutally honest, just like you asked.</div>
