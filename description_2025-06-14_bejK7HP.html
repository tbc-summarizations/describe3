  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutal roasting of the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifier Group B matchday results, as requested:

<strong>1. France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· [QUALIFIED FOR EURO 2024]</strong>

France, you smug bastards. You qualify with ease and then decide to humiliate Gibraltar with a 14-0 scoreline? It's like watching a bunch of bullies beating up a toddler. I bet your fans were bored by the 60th minute. Embarrassing for everyone involved.

<strong>Matchday 1</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· 4-0 ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±: You gave the Netherlands a good spanking, and you should've made it worse.
â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡® 0-3 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·: Gibraltar, the whipping boys of Europe. This loss just set the tone for the rest of your pathetic campaign. At least you were consistent in your shittiness.

<strong>Matchday 2</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± 3-0 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡®: The Netherlands took out their anger on Gibraltar.
â€¢   ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª 0-1 ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·: Ireland can't even score one goal against France at home? Pathetic.

<strong>Matchday 3</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡® 0-3 ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·: France, stop picking on Gibraltar. It's not a challenge, it's a charity match.
â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· 2-1 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª: Greece, barely scraping by against the Irish. At least you managed to win but you're still mid.

<strong>Matchday 4</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· 1-0 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·: France barely edged out a win against Greece. You should've crushed them.
â€¢   ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª 3-0 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡®: Ireland finally finds someone they can beat. Congrats on your moral victory!

<strong>Matchday 5</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· 2-0 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª: You're like a broken record, Ireland.
â€¢   ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± 3-0 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·: Netherlands, at least you won with a clean sheet.

<strong>Matchday 6</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· 5-0 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡®: Greece, you barely manage to score against Gibraltar, but congrats for at least keeping up with the Netherlands and Ireland.
â€¢   ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª 1-2 ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±: Ireland showed a glimpse of hope only to ruin everything again.

<strong>Matchday 7</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± 1-2 ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·: Netherlands, you had a chance to make France suffer but you blew it.
â€¢   ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª 0-2 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·: Ireland, you let Greece stomp on you in your own ground. Pathetic.

<strong>Matchday 8</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡® 0-4 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª: Gibraltar is already beaten, but Ireland couldn't help beating them more.
â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· 0-1 ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±: Another terrible performance, Greece. At least you got to the play-offs via Nations League, but that's as far as you're going.

<strong>Matchday 9</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· 14-0 ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡®: This is the peak of humiliation for both teams. Gibraltar should just stay home.
â€¢   ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± 1-0 ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª: Netherlands, barely winning against Ireland? Disgraceful.

<strong>Matchday 10</strong>

â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡® 0-6 ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±: Gibraltar must be tired of getting their asses kicked every match.
â€¢   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· 2-2 ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·: Greece, congrats on drawing with France and denying them 1st place.

<em>In summary, Gibraltar is garbage, Ireland sucks, Greece is mid, Netherlands is mid and France is good but should've done better.</em></div>
