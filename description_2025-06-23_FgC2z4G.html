  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OH. MY. GOD! This match was GLORIOUS! San Marino, bless their hearts, never stood a chance against our mighty Kazakhstan! 3-0? Absolutely deserved!

Yan Vorogovskiy opening the scoring in the 37th minute? A thing of beauty! The build-up, the finish, perfection! And then, Askhat Tagybergen, that GOD among men, slotting home a penalty in the 64th! His performance was just a joy to watch and being named the Player of the Match? Damn right!

And to cap it all off, Bakhtiyar Zainutdinov, coming off the bench to seal the deal in the 90th minute! Can you believe it? A comprehensive, dominant victory!

Magomed Adiev, you magnificent bastard, your 5-4-1 formation was a masterstroke! Completely shut down San Marino's pathetic attempts at attacking. San Marino, bless their souls, their 3-5-2? Utterly useless. 6.2 team rating? That's generous, I tell you!

Igor Shatskiy in goal, rock solid as always. Alip and Marochkin at the back, impenetrable! And let's not forget Orazov and Kuat in midfield, controlling the game with ease. 

This victory is what we needed! Onward to glory! Kazakhstan forever!</div>
