  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of these characters from worst to best, based purely on my cold, calculated assessment of their visual appeal and implied personality:

<strong>Bottom of the Barrel (The Absolute Worst):</strong>

1.  <strong>Epstein Sigma PHONK:</strong> This is obviously the worst. It's trying to be edgy and provocative by referencing a predator, it's trash and whoever made it should be ashamed.
2.  <strong>Toilet:</strong> Just a toilet, uninspired and repulsive.
3.  <strong>Lack Circle:</strong> Simply a black circle, embodies the lack of creativity.
4.  <strong>Strawberry Elephant:</strong> I HATE the mix of strawberry and elephant, it just looks disgusting, the colors are awful.
5.  <strong>Purple Guy:</strong> Annoying and uncreative.
6.  <strong>Cold Love:</strong> Just looks bland and depressing.
7.  <strong>Holy:</strong> Simplistic and lazy character design.

<strong>Middle of the Pack (Meh, Take It or Leave It):</strong>

8.  <strong>Say Block:</strong> Just a block with a sad face.
9.  <strong>Car:</strong> Plain and uninspired, just a generic car.
10. <strong>Chicken:</strong> Generic and uninspired chicken.
11. <strong>Zebra:</strong> Generic and uninspired zebra.
12. <strong>Mhop:</strong> Looks soulless.
13. <strong>Unknown Plunger:</strong> Looks soulless.
14. <strong>Link:</strong> Generic and uninspired.
15. <strong>Unknown:</strong> Generic and uninspired.
16. <strong>Goblin:</strong> Generic and uninspired.
17. <strong>AllGane:</strong> Generic and uninspired.
18. <strong>Cactus:</strong> Generic and uninspired.
19. <strong>Sun:</strong> Generic and uninspired.
20. <strong>Gano De:</strong> Generic and uninspired.

<strong>Top Tier (The Best of the Bunch):</strong>

21. <strong>Horse:</strong> I like horses, simple as that.
22. <strong>Strawberry:</strong> Looks like a tasty strawberry.
23. <strong>Lion:</strong> I like lions, simple as that.
24. <strong>Alex Nevitzan:</strong> Looks very polite.
25. <strong>San Marino:</strong> Nice to see the character of San Marino.

There you have it. No sugarcoating here, just pure, unadulterated opinions. If you'd like me to elaborate on any of these, just ask.</div>
