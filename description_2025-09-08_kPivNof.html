  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these matches. No holds barred.

•   <strong>Norway 3-0 Lithuania:</strong> Norway, finally doing what they should be doing against a minnow like Lithuania. Lithuania, go home, you're drunk.

•   <strong>Scotland 1-2 Belarus:</strong> Scotland, how do you lose to Belarus? Seriously? Get it together. Belarus, congrats on the fluke victory, enjoy it while it lasts.

•   <strong>Slovakia 3-1 Austria:</strong> Slovakia, nice job showing Austria who's boss. Austria, typical underachievers, living up to expectations.

•   <strong>Kosovo 2-1 Cyprus:</strong> Kosovo, a win is a win, even if it's against Cyprus. Cyprus, close but no cigar, try harder next time, or maybe not.

•   <strong>Sweden 2-0 Kazakhstan:</strong> Sweden, predictable win, nothing to write home about. Kazakhstan, thanks for showing up, I guess.

•   <strong>Faroe Islands 2-0 Iceland:</strong> Faroe Islands, shocking win! Iceland, what happened to your Euro 2016 magic? Embarrassing.

•   <strong>Russia 1-0 Montenegro:</strong> Russia, barely scraping by against Montenegro. Step it up. Montenegro, valiant effort, but still a loss.

•   <strong>Israel 4-1 Andorra:</strong> Israel, expected win against Andorra, next. Andorra, at least you scored a goal, small victories.

•   <strong>Liechtenstein 0-4 Slovenia:</strong> Slovenia, crushing Liechtenstein, as they should. Liechtenstein, might as well not even bother showing up.

•   <strong>Albania 0-1 Czechia:</strong> Czechia, a narrow escape against Albania. Albania, almost pulled off the upset, close but no cigar.

•   <strong>Moldova 1-2 Greece:</strong> Greece, barely beating Moldova, your glory days are long gone. Moldova, at least you put up a fight.

•   <strong>Serbia 1-0 Armenia:</strong> Serbia, another unconvincing win. Armenia, better luck next time.

•   <strong>Finland 2-0 Latvia:</strong> Finland, solid win against Latvia. Latvia, nothing to see here.

•   <strong>Luxembourg 1-1 Ukraine:</strong> Luxembourg, holding Ukraine to a draw, not bad. Ukraine, disappointing result, need to do better.

•   <strong>Poland 1-0 Romania:</strong> Poland, grinding out a win against Romania. Romania, could have been worse.

•   <strong>Gibraltar 2-0 Azerbaijan:</strong> Gibraltar, massive upset! Azerbaijan, how do you lose to Gibraltar? Pathetic.

•   <strong>Denmark 2-1 North Macedonia:</strong> Denmark, close win against North Macedonia. North Macedonia, good effort, but not enough.

•   <strong>Malta 1-2 Northern Ireland:</strong> Northern Ireland, eking out a win against Malta. Malta, always the bridesmaid.

•   <strong>Georgia 1-2 Wales:</strong> Wales, tough win in Georgia. Georgia, so close, yet so far.

•   <strong>Bosnia 5-0 San Marino:</strong> Bosnia, obliterating San Marino, as expected. San Marino, just happy to be there.

•   <strong>Ireland 3-1 Bulgaria:</strong> Ireland, comfortable win against Bulgaria. Bulgaria, another loss to add to the pile.

•   <strong>Turkey 2-0 Estonia:</strong> Turkey, standard win against Estonia. Estonia, predictable.

There you have it. Brutally honest commentary on each match. No sugarcoating.</div>
