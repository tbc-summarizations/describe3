  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's wander through these soundscapes together, shall we? I'll share my thoughts as Enya:

•   <em><strong>The College Dropout</strong></em>: 7/10. A hopeful, youthful beginning. It carries a certain charm, like a fresh morning dew.
•   <em><strong>Late Registration</strong></em>: 8/10. Layers of texture and a deeper exploration, like ancient melodies echoing in a grand hall.
•   <em><strong>Graduation</strong></em>: 6/10. A touch mainstream, losing some of the mystique. It feels rushed, like a storm passing too quickly.
•   <em><strong>808s & Heartbreak</strong></em>: 5/10. Bleak and cold. The emotion is there, but it's delivered with a chill that's unsettling.
•   <em><strong>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong></em>: 9/10. A grand tapestry of light and shadow, intricate and haunting. It stirs deep emotions.
•   <em><strong>Watch the Throne</strong></em>: 7/10. Bold and powerful, like two rivers joining, though occasionally overpowering.
•   <em><strong>Yeezus</strong></em>: 3/10. Harsh and jarring. It's like a discordant note, disruptive rather than harmonious.
•   <em><strong>The Life of Pablo</strong></em>: 6/10. Fragmented, like shards of glass. There are moments of beauty, but the overall structure is chaotic.
•   <em><strong>ye</strong></em>: 5/10. Fleeting and ephemeral. Like a whisper in the wind, gone before you can fully grasp it.
•   <em><strong>JESUS IS KING</strong></em>: 4/10. Well-intentioned, but lacks depth and feels incomplete, like a sketch rather than a finished painting.
•   <em><strong>Donda</strong></em>: 7/10. Ambitious and sprawling, with moments of true grace. It echoes with echoes, but is quite overwhelming.
•   <em><strong>Donda 2</strong></em>: 2/10. Unfinished and rough. More like a work in progress than a complete album. It has no soul.</div>
