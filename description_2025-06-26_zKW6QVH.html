  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these French clubs and give them some brutally honest ratings out of 10, focusing on their overall stature and performance within France:

•   <strong>Angers:</strong> 3/10. They're a team that often struggles in Ligue 1. Consistently battling relegation, they lack the historical success or consistent investment to be considered a top club. Mediocrity is their trademark.

•   <strong>AS Monaco:</strong> 7.5/10. Historically a strong team with periods of dominance, Monaco has the financial backing to be a serious contender. However, inconsistent performances and an over-reliance on selling key players hinder them from reaching their full potential.

•   <strong>AS Saint-Etienne:</strong> 6/10. A once-dominant force in French football, Saint-Etienne has fallen from grace. While they have a rich history and passionate fanbase, recent relegations and financial issues have significantly tarnished their reputation.

•   <strong>Auxerre:</strong> 4/10. They had their moments of glory in the past, but Auxerre is largely irrelevant in modern French football. Their limited resources and lack of star power make them an underdog in most matches.

•   <strong>Brest:</strong> 3/10. Another team that's usually fighting to avoid relegation, Brest lacks the financial muscle and star power to compete at the highest level. They're generally considered a small club with limited ambitions.

•   <strong>FC Nantes:</strong> 6/10. Historically a strong team with a legacy in French football, Nantes has experienced periods of decline. While they've had some recent successes, they're not consistently competing for top honors.

•   <strong>Le Havre:</strong> 3/10. A club with occasional spells in Ligue 1, Le Havre struggles to establish themselves as a consistent top-flight team. They lack the resources and infrastructure to compete with the bigger clubs.

•   <strong>Lille:</strong> 7/10. They've had moments of brilliance, including winning Ligue 1 against all odds, but Lille struggles with consistency. Financial constraints often force them to sell their best players, hindering their ability to build a sustained challenge.

•   <strong>Montpellier:</strong> 5/10. They had a surprising Ligue 1 title win, but Montpellier has generally been a mid-table team. They lack the consistent investment and star power to challenge the top clubs regularly.

•   <strong>Nice:</strong> 6.5/10. Nice has shown flashes of potential, attracting talented players and managers. However, they often struggle to maintain consistency and lack the historical success of the traditional powerhouses.

•   <strong>Olympique De Marseille:</strong> 8/10. A club with a rich history and passionate fanbase, Marseille is always a force to be reckoned with. However, internal turmoil and inconsistent performances have prevented them from reaching their full potential.

•   <strong>Olympique Lyonnais:</strong> 8/10. Historically one of the most successful clubs in France, Lyon has struggled to maintain its dominance in recent years. However, they still have a strong squad and infrastructure, making them a serious contender.

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> 9.5/10. Dominated by Qatari investment, PSG has become the undisputed powerhouse of French football. With a star-studded squad and unparalleled financial resources, they are expected to win every trophy. However, their lack of Champions League success prevents them from being rated a perfect 10.

•   <strong>RC Lens:</strong> 7/10. A club with a passionate fanbase and a strong tradition, Lens has made a resurgence in recent years. They play attractive football and are always a tough opponent, but lack the resources of the bigger clubs.

•   <strong>RC Strasbourg:</strong> 5/10. Strasbourg is a club with a decent history, but has struggled to maintain consistency in recent years. They are typically a mid-table team, lacking the financial muscle to compete at the highest level.

•   <strong>Stade De Reims:</strong> 5/10. A club with a storied past, Reims has struggled to replicate its earlier success. They are generally a mid-table team, lacking the resources to consistently challenge the top clubs.

•   <strong>Stade Rennais:</strong> 7/10. Rennes has emerged as a consistent contender in recent years, investing in their academy and attracting talented players. They play attractive football and have a good infrastructure, but lack the historical success of the traditional powerhouses.

•   <strong>Toulouse:</strong> 4/10. Toulouse is a club that often bounces between Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. They lack the financial stability and star power to compete consistently at the highest level.</div>
