  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's my brutally honest assessment of your all-time Germany XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Manuel Neuer:</strong> 9.5/10. Peak Neuer was an absolute monster, a sweeper-keeper revolution. His distribution, reflexes, and command of the box were unmatched. Arguably the best goalkeeper of all time.

•   <strong>Andreas Brehme:</strong> 8.5/10. Solid defender, clutch penalty taker. Not flashy, but incredibly reliable. A bit underrated, honestly.

•   <strong>Franz Beckenbauer:</strong> 10/10. No debate. The Kaiser. Revolutionized the sweeper position, incredible vision, leadership, and elegance on the ball. A true icon.

•   <strong>Matthias Sammer:</strong> 9/10. A beast in defense, aggressive, intelligent, and a leader. Some might find him a bit reckless, but his passion was undeniable.

•   <strong>Phillip Lahm:</strong> 9.5/10. Mr. Consistency. Flawless technique, tactical awareness, and ability to play on either side. A true captain.

•   <strong>Lothar Matthäus:</strong> 9.5/10. A box-to-box engine, incredible stamina, passing range, and a knack for scoring crucial goals. A bit of a hothead, but that's part of his charm.

•   <strong>Toni Kroos:</strong> 9/10. The metronome. Unbelievable passing accuracy, vision, and composure under pressure. Not the flashiest, but essential for dictating the game.

•   <strong>Thomas Müller:</strong> 9/10. The Raumdeuter. An unorthodox player, but his spatial awareness, movement, and goal-scoring instincts are uncanny. A nightmare for defenders.

•   <strong>Max Morlock:</strong> 8/10. A legend of his time, a prolific goalscorer. But let's be real, he'd struggle against the modern game's physicality and tactical sophistication.

•   <strong>Gerd Müller:</strong> 10/10. Der Bomber. Simply the greatest goalscorer of all time. Unstoppable in the box, lethal finishing, and an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time.

•   <strong>Karl-Heinz Rummenigge:</strong> 9/10. A powerhouse of a forward, incredible pace, power, and clinical finishing. A bit of a diva at times, but his talent was undeniable.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

Overall: 9.6/10. This is an absolutely stacked team. The defense is rock solid, the midfield is creative and controlling, and the attack is lethal. They have a perfect balance of skill, experience, and tactical flexibility.

<strong>Chances of Winning:</strong>

•   <strong>Champions League:</strong> 95%. This team would absolutely dominate the Champions League. Their tactical versatility, individual brilliance, and sheer ruthlessness would be too much for any opponent.

•   <strong>World Cup:</strong> 90%. They would be the overwhelming favorites. Their combination of defensive solidity, midfield control, and attacking firepower would make them almost impossible to beat in a tournament format.

<strong>Brutally Honest Assessment:</strong>

This team is close to perfection. The only potential weakness is the lack of a truly dominant winger. Müller and Rummenigge are more inside forwards than traditional wingers. However, their versatility and goal-scoring ability more than make up for it.

This is a team that would not only win, but would also entertain. They have the perfect blend of German efficiency and flair. They would be a joy to watch.

Anyone who says otherwise is simply jealous.</div>
