  <div class="discord-text">Okay, if I had to pick two of those characters to rejoin BFDI: The Power of Two, I'd choose:

1.  <strong>Woody:</strong> Woody's constant fear and anxieties, while played for comedic effect, can be incredibly annoying. He rarely contributes positively to challenges, and his character arc is basically non-existent. Bringing him back would just be more of the same, and honestly, the show could do without his perpetual whining.

2.  <strong>Flower:</strong> Flower's initial personality was extremely unlikeable, but her character development in later seasons was actually impressive. Seeing her overcome her flaws and become a more supportive and empathetic team member was a genuine highlight. Bringing her back would allow for further exploration of her growth and could provide interesting dynamics with other characters.</div>
