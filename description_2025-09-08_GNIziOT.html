  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to be brutal. Kazakhstan's football performance this decade has beenâ€¦ uneven, to put it kindly. Let's dissect the carnage:

<strong>Top 5 Best Matches (Relatively Speaking):</strong>

1.  <strong>Kazakhstan 3-2 Denmark (2023, Euro Qualifiers):</strong> This is the clear winner. Beating a team like Denmark is a massive upset for any nation in UEFA, let alone Kazakhstan. The fact that it was a comeback victory makes it even more sweet for the Kazakhs.
2.  <strong>Northern Ireland 0-1 Kazakhstan (2023, Euro Qualifiers):</strong> Winning away against Northern Ireland isn't the most glamorous achievement, but it's a valuable scalp. A composed display against a side they were evenly matched with and secured a clean sheet to go with the victory.
3.  <strong>Slovakia 0-1 Kazakhstan (2022, UEFA Nations League):</strong> Slovakia were a much better ranked side than Kazakhstan, therefore this away win in Trnava was amazing. It also proved to be a major factor in why Kazakhstan would win the group and get promoted into League B.
4.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-1 Slovakia (2022, UEFA Nations League):</strong> It just felt right to put both the matches against Slovakia in this list, it really exemplified the improvements Kazakhstan were making at the time. A very strong home win which helped make the Nations League campaign a very successful one.
5.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-0 Azerbaijan (2022, UEFA Nations League):</strong> This match was the start of a very special and successful campaign for Kazakhstan, with them eventually getting promoted to League B. The match itself was a comfortable win that showed the improvements being made.

<strong>Top 5 Worst Matches (The Absolute Disasters):</strong>

1.  <strong>France 8-0 Kazakhstan (2021, World Cup Qualifiers):</strong> This was pure, unadulterated humiliation. Being thrashed like this on the international stage is soul-crushing. It's a testament to the sheer gulf in class. No excuses.
2.  <strong>Greece 5-0 Kazakhstan (2024, Euro Qualifiers Play-off):</strong> When it mattered most, they crumbled. The Euro dream died in a heap of defensive errors and tactical ineptitude. A play-off should be competitive, not a massacre.
3.  <strong>Belgium 6-0 Kazakhstan (2025, World Cup Qualifiers):</strong> A truly pathetic and embarrassing display that proves how far off Kazakhstan are from reaching a high level of football. This result proved they were lucky to be performing well in the 2022 Nations League campaign.
4.  <strong>Norway 5-0 Kazakhstan (2024, UEFA Nations League):</strong> As the other side of the Slovakia wins showed the progression of Kazakhstan, these losses show how little the side have improved and that it was just a fluke. A humiliating result, Kazakhstan never looked like getting anything in this match.
5.  <strong>North Macedonia 4-0 Kazakhstan (2021, Friendly):</strong> A friendly is supposed to be a chance to experiment and build. Instead, Kazakhstan got demolished by a team that, while decent, shouldn't be putting four past them so easily. This suggests a complete lack of preparation or tactical understanding.</div>
