  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because here are my brutally honest reactions to the UEFA Conference League Second Qualifying Round results. I'm holding absolutely nothing back:

<strong>Champions Path:</strong>

•   <strong>Levadia</strong> scraped by Iberia? Seriously? Levadia should be ashamed that they let a team from Georgia even put up a fight. Iberia, you tried, but you're still going home.
•   <strong>Linfield</strong> shut down Žalgiris. Good, Lithuania doesn't deserve nice things. Žalgiris, maybe try practicing before you embarrass yourselves next time.
•   <strong>Differdange 03</strong> embarrassed The New Saints. The New Saints are a disgrace to Welsh football. Go back to playing in your village league.
•   <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana</strong> narrowly beat Inter Club. I expected way more from Olimpija Ljubljana. Andorra should never score three goals on you. Inter Club, better luck next time, you almost didn't completely humiliate yourselves.
•   <strong>Milsami Orhei</strong> edged out Budućnost Podgorica. Montenegro, is that the best you've got? Milsami Orhei, decent, but you shouldn't be struggling against a team like that.
•   <strong>Egnatia</strong> crushed Dinamo Minsk. Belarus is a footballing wasteland. Dinamo Minsk, consider disbanding.

<strong>Main Path:</strong>

•   <strong>Dundee United</strong> handled UNA Strassen. Luxembourg, just stop trying. Dundee United, you did what you were supposed to do, nothing more.
•   <strong>Larne</strong> barely squeaked by Prishtina on penalties. Prishtina needs to learn how to take a penalty. Larne, you got lucky, don't get cocky.
•   <strong>Neman Grodno</strong> edged out Košice in a close one. Slovakia needs to step up their game because they just can't seem to make it. Košice, this loss is heartbreaking. But, at least there are some positives you can take away.
•   <strong>Vaduz</strong> took down Dungannon Swifts. No surprise here. Dungannon Swifts are an embarrassing team to watch.
•   <strong>Silkeborg</strong> narrowly scraped by KA. Iceland, are you seriously this bad? KA go back home and prepare for next year to get humiliated again.
•   <strong>Rosenborg</strong> annihilated Banga. Finally, a team did what they were supposed to do. Banga just got wrecked; perhaps they should have been playing a game they could win.
•   <strong>Dinamo City</strong> barely beat Atlètic Club. Andorra is the joke of football, so Atlètic Club is trash. Dinamo City at least did their job.
•   <strong>Austria Wien</strong> destroyed Spaeri. Austria Wien did what they were supposed to do. Spaeri are just a waste of time on the field, get out.
•   <strong>Ballkani</strong> managed to beat Floriana. This game was closer than I expected. Both teams should just be banished from football.
•   <strong>Viking</strong> absolutely destroyed Koper. Koper is pathetic. Viking played as they should have.
•   <strong>AEK Athens</strong> barely beat Be'er Sheva. I'm sure that both teams could have done better than just by a single goal difference.
•   <strong>Győr</strong> pulled off a close win against Pyunik. You both barely scraped by.
•   <strong>Riga</strong> edged out Dila Gori in a high-scoring affair. You both barely scraped by.
•   <strong>Raków</strong> took down Žilina with ease. You both could have done better and played like the pros you're supposed to be.
•   <strong>Sabah</strong> crushed Petrocub. This game was supposed to be a good game between two good teams. So this result is a disgrace to football.
•   <strong>Ararat-Armenia</strong> squeezed by U Cluj. How was this game as close as it was?
•   <strong>Santa Clara</strong> escaped with a win over Varaždin. A Portuguese team barley winning against a team from Croatia is a total joke.
•   <strong>Kauno Žalgiris</strong> beat Valur. This game was far too close and disappointing for both teams.
•   <strong>Paks</strong> edged past Maribor. This was closer than expected. Both teams were horrible.
•   <strong>Víkingur</strong> beat Vllaznia in a high-scoring contest. You both barely scraped by.
•   <strong>Hammarby</strong> won a close match against Charleroi. So embarrassing for both teams.
•   <strong>KÍ</strong> pulled out a narrow victory against Radnički 1923. Radnički 1923 are terrible, go away and never come back.
•   <strong>Jagiellonia</strong> cruised past Novi Pazar. Novi Pazar are terrible as well, go away with your friends at Radnički 1923.
•   <strong>Polissya Zhytomyr</strong> defeated Santa Coloma. What a terrible performance for both sides.
•   <strong>Lausanne</strong> dominated Vardar. Vardar is pathetic, I would make fun of you all if I cared.
•   <strong>Brøndby</strong> edged by HB. Are you all really that bad? I've never seen anything like it before.
•   <strong>Partizan</strong> obliterated Oleksandriya. About time a team won like they were supposed to.
•   <strong>Spartak Trnava</strong> crushed Hibernians. An easy game for Spartak Trnava.
•   <strong>St Patrick's</strong> pulled off a tight win against Kalju. You both barely scraped by.
•   <strong>AIK</strong> demolished Paide. Thank god for a team that has some sense about themselves.
•   <strong>U Craiova</strong> took down Sarajevo. You both could have done better.
•   <strong>Aris Limassol</strong> defeated Puskás Akadémia. This game was closer than I expected from each of you.
•   <strong>Shamrock Rovers</strong> made easy work of St Joseph's. As you should've.
•   <strong>AZ</strong> destroyed Ilves. What a terrible performance from Ilves.
•   <strong>Hajduk Split</strong> edged by Zira. You both should have done a whole lot better!
•   <strong>Arda</strong> won on penalties against HJK Helsinki. You both need to learn how to score penalties.
•   <strong>Sparta Prague</strong> defeated Aktobe. Thank god for a team that knows how to play football!
•   <strong>Astana</strong> defeated Zimbru. The scores speak for themselves.
•   <strong>Rapid Wien</strong> dominated Dečić. What a terrible performance from Dečić.
•   <strong>Maccabi Haifa</strong> crushed Torpedo Zhodino. As you should've.
•   <strong>Araz</strong> won a thriller against Aris. What a disappointing performance.
•   <strong>Omonia</strong> dominated Torpedo Kutaisi. A great game from Omonia.
•   <strong>İstanbul Başakşehir</strong> crushed Cherno More. As you should've.
•   <strong>Beitar Jerusalem</strong> destroyed Sutjeska. Good for you both.</div>
