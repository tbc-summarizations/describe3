  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this group stage performance with the honesty it deserves.

<strong>Top Performers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Germany:</strong> Dominated Group C without conceding a single goal. This is ruthless efficiency. No-nonsense, business-like.
â€¢   <strong>Brazil:</strong> Strolled through Group D with a +8 goal difference. They barely broke a sweat. This screams of a team coasting with talent to spare.
â€¢   <strong>Peru:</strong> Topping Group F without a goal conceded is a defensive masterclass. An incredible defensive performance that deserves respect.

<strong>Biggest Underachievers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Canada:</strong> Absolutely pathetic. Zero points and a -5 goal difference? They were there just to make up the numbers.
â€¢   <strong>Argentina:</strong> I'm sorry, but this is a disgrace. Zero wins in Group E? What happened to Messi's magic? They should just forfeit from now on.
â€¢   <strong>Moldova:</strong> Did they even bother showing up? Zero goals scored and six conceded. Embarrassing.

<strong>Surprises (Good):</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> Second in Group C behind Germany is a solid achievement. They exceeded expectations.

<strong>Disappointments:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>United States:</strong> They managed to qualify but a terrible 4-2 goal difference means they barely crawled by.
â€¢   <strong>South Korea:</strong> They had no chances.

<strong>Matches That Raised Eyebrows:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 3-1 Russia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º:</strong> This result seemed completely out of character, given the later performances of both teams. Either one side got lucky, or the other underestimated the opposition.
â€¢   <strong>Romania 0-4 Brazil:</strong> This result suggests one team had no defensive qualities.

Overall, the group stage revealed a mix of expected dominance and utter failures. Some teams are clearly contenders, while others need a serious overhaul if they want to compete.</div>
