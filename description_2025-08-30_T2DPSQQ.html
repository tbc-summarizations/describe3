  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this Club Brugge lineup with the brutal honesty you asked for:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Simon Mignolet (GK): 7.5</strong> - A seasoned veteran, Mignolet still has decent shot-stopping ability and experience. However, he is prone to errors and his distribution is not top-tier for a modern goalkeeper. He's reliable but far from world-class at this stage of his career.

•   <strong>Joaquin Seys (DF): 5</strong> - A promising young defender with the potential to improve. Lacks experience and tactical awareness, often getting caught out of position and struggling against pacey wingers. Needs time and development to become a reliable starter.

•   <strong>Joel Ordóñez (DF): 6</strong> - Physically strong and a decent tackler, but lacks composure and decision-making skills in crucial moments. Can be prone to rash challenges and struggles with aerial duels against bigger opponents.

•   <strong>Brandon Mechele (DF): 6.5</strong> - A solid and experienced defender, but lacks pace and agility. Can be a liability against quick and skillful attackers. His experience is valuable, but his physical limitations are a concern.

•   <strong>Kyriani Sabbe (DF): 5.5</strong> - Energetic and willing to get forward, but lacks defensive discipline and positional awareness. Can be exploited by clever wingers and struggles with tracking back effectively.

•   <strong>Raphael Onyedika (MF): 7</strong> - A promising defensive midfielder with good energy and tackling ability. Still developing his passing range and tactical awareness, but has the potential to become a key player.

•   <strong>Aleksandar Stanković (MF): 5.5</strong> - Decent passer with a good work rate. But lacks the physicality and defensive prowess to protect the backline effectively. Needs to improve his consistency and impact on the game.

•   <strong>Hans Vanaken (MF): 7</strong> - Experienced playmaker with good vision and passing ability. However, his age is catching up to him, and he lacks the pace and stamina to consistently influence games. Still capable of moments of brilliance, but his overall impact is declining.

•   <strong>Christos Tzolis (FW): 6</strong> - Decent dribbler with an eye for goal. Lacks consistency and can be selfish in front of goal. Needs to improve his decision-making and teamwork.

•   <strong>Nicolò Tresoldi (FW): 5</strong> - Young striker with potential, but lacks experience and a proven goal-scoring record. Needs time to develop and adapt to the demands of top-level football.

•   <strong>Michal Skoras (FW): 5.5</strong> - Hardworking winger with decent pace. Lacks the technical ability and creativity to consistently create chances. Struggles to beat defenders and deliver quality crosses.

<strong>Team Rating: 5.5/10</strong>

Overall, this Club Brugge lineup is underwhelming. While Mignolet and Vanaken provide experience, the team lacks quality and consistency in key areas. The defense is vulnerable, the midfield lacks balance, and the attack is unproven. They would struggle against top teams and would likely finish in the mid-table if they don't improve significantly. This is far from a title-contending squad.</div>
