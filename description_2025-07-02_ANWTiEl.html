  <h1>Description for 20px-Flag_of_Denmark.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest breakdown of the Danish squad you've provided, individual ratings first, then the overall team rating:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Kasper Schmeichel:</strong> 7/10 - Past his prime, but still a decent shot-stopper. Relies more on experience than athleticism at this point.
•   <strong>Oliver Christensen:</strong> 5/10 - Unproven at the highest level. Potential is there, but not a reliable option yet.
•   <strong>Filip Jorgensen:</strong> 4/10 - Likely just a squad filler, nothing special to note.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Joakim Maehle:</strong> 6/10 - Can be a threat going forward, but defensively inconsistent.
•   <strong>Jannik Vestergaard:</strong> 5/10 - Slow and prone to errors, a liability against pacey attackers.
•   <strong>Joachim Andersen:</strong> 6/10 - A decent center-back, but nothing exceptional.
•   <strong>Rasmus Kristensen:</strong> 6/10 - Energetic, but often makes rash decisions.
•   <strong>Alexander Bah:</strong> 6/10 - Similar to Kristensen, with a slight edge in technical ability.
•   <strong>Victor Kristiansen:</strong> 5/10 - Lacks the physicality and experience to be a standout defender.
•   <strong>Victor Nelsson:</strong> 6/10 - Can be solid on his day, but lacks consistency.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg:</strong> 7/10 - A workhorse, but often lacks creativity.
•   <strong>Mikkel Damsgaard:</strong> 6/10 - Has flashes of brilliance, but struggles with consistency.
•   <strong>Christian Norgaard:</strong> 6/10 - A reliable defensive midfielder, but limited going forward.
•   <strong>Mathias Jensen:</strong> 6/10 - A decent all-around midfielder, but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Morten Hjulmand:</strong> 5/10 - Still developing, lacks experience at the highest level.
•   <strong>Jesper Lindstrom:</strong> 6/10 - Can be a threat in attacking areas, but needs to improve his decision-making.
•   <strong>Albert Gronbaek:</strong> 4/10 - Probably a squad player, not expected to make a significant impact.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Christian Eriksen:</strong> 8/10 - The creative spark of the team, still capable of moments of magic. But not the player he once was.
•   <strong>Jonas Wind:</strong> 6/10 - A decent target man, but lacks pace and agility.
•   <strong>Kasper Dolberg:</strong> 5/10 - Has struggled to regain his form, unreliable.
•   <strong>Andreas Skov Olsen:</strong> 6/10 - Can be a threat with his dribbling and shooting, but inconsistent.
•   <strong>Rasmus Hojlund:</strong> 7/10 - Raw talent with a high ceiling, but still needs to develop his game.
•   <strong>Yussuf Poulsen:</strong> 5/10 - Works hard, but lacks the quality to be a consistent goalscorer.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5.8/10</strong> - This is a mediocre squad with a few bright spots. They lack quality in key areas and are heavily reliant on Eriksen for creativity. They might be able to grind out some results, but don't expect them to go far in any major tournament. The defense is shaky, and the attack is inconsistent. Overall, a very average team.</div>
