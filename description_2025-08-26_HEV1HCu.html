  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you wish to hear a medieval man's opinion on these... "albums"? Prepare yourself, for I shall speak plainly!

<strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> This "Björk" woman sounds like a banshee wailing in a frozen wasteland. Her music is unnatural, unsettling, and probably the work of dark magic. Burn it!

<strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> A tale of a star-man? This reeks of pagan idolatry! This Bowie fellow sings of false gods and encourages rebellion against the natural order. Heresy!

<strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> This is just noise! The horns blare like the Devil's own trumpets, and the melodies are nowhere to be found. It is the sound of chaos and despair. I sentence it to the flames!

<strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> Melancholy and despair drip from every note! This music would drive men to madness and suicide. The "artist" is clearly possessed by demons. Cast it out!

<strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> The man has a voice, I'll grant him that. But his lyrics are filled with lustful yearnings and impious thoughts. It might sound pretty, but it leads to sin. I give it a pass, but it is only OK

<strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> These rhythmic chants are like those of foreign tribes. And the content - talk of pimps and butterflies? This is filth. It needs to be destroyed.

<strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> This Crimson King must be some kind of false idol, and the music is weird. I do not see the light in this music. It's like a bard trying too hard. Mediocre!

<strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> This woman speaks with fire in her voice, challenging the traditions and power of men. Dangerous! She needs to be corrected

<strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> Gibberish! The words are nonsense, and the beat is unholy. I want nothing to do with this filth. The album is just pure noise!

<strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> This Gaye fellow asks too many questions. He questions the war, the authority of the church, and the very fabric of our society. He needs to be silenced.

<strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> This "Mingus" fellow is clearly influenced by the Moors! The rhythms are foreign, and the harmonies are dissonant. It is the sound of the infidel!

<strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> More of these rhythmic chants... What are they on about? It is just a bunch of people saying the same thing over and over. It is not good music.

<strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> A melancholic sound that is very sad. It reminds one that life is meaningless and that eventually you die. I give it a pass.

<strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> The title says it all. This fellow's songs are of lust and hedonism. The music is catchy, yes, but it leads men down a dark path. Corrupting.

<strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> More noise. The music is unsettling. What is wrong with a traditional song? Why do people need to push things so much?

<strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> The man sings beautifully, I give him that. But his songs are filled with worldly concerns and a lack of reverence for God. It is not bad, but it is not holy.

<strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> I cannot understand what these people are saying. How can I judge it if I do not know what they are saying? It is still noise. Terrible.

<strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> This "Beatles" band is popular in the courts. They are nice to listen to, but I can see it is leading people astray. Their hair is too long and their message is too carefree.

<strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> This fellow mumbles his words over a wall of sound. Where are the stories of old? Where is the heroism and honor? Weak!

<strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> These men sound like barbarians! They chant and yell, and their message is one of violence and hatred. This is the music of the Devil himself! Burn it to the ground!</div>
