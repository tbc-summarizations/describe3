  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into this hypothetical Real Madrid lineup with the brutal honesty you requested:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Thibaut Courtois (Goalkeeper): 9/10</strong>. When fit, he's a world-class shot-stopper and commands his area well. However, recent injuries are a concern, so the rating reflects his peak ability, not necessarily current availability.

•   <strong>Álvaro Carreras (Left Back): 6/10</strong>. He's young and has potential, but he's unproven at the highest level. He would have a lot of pressure playing in the Champions League with Real.

•   <strong>Dean Huijsen (Center Back): 6/10.</strong> Decent young player however, playing for Juventus which is currently struggling.

•   <strong>Raúl Asencio (Center Back): 5/10.</strong> Who? Honestly, never heard of him. If he's starting for Real Madrid, something has gone horribly wrong with their scouting and youth system.

•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold (Right Back): 7/10</strong>. This is a tough one. His attacking quality is undeniable, but his defensive lapses are a massive liability against top opposition. If Madrid can cover for him defensively, he's a weapon, but if not, he's a weakness waiting to be exploited.

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham (Central Midfield): 10/10.</strong> The heart and soul of the team. Phenomenal box-to-box player with goals, creativity, and leadership. An absolute must-have.

•   <strong>Federico Valverde (Central Midfield): 8/10.</strong> A workhorse with incredible energy and versatility. Can play multiple positions and provides crucial support defensively and offensively. He is good.

•   <strong>Aurélien Tchouaméni (Defensive Midfield): 7/10.</strong> Good at tackling and breaking up play, but his passing range and decision-making under pressure need improvement. Too many errors.

•   <strong>Vinícius Júnior (Left Wing): 9/10</strong>. A constant threat with his pace, dribbling, and finishing ability. Can be inconsistent at times, and prone to theatrics, but on his day, he's unstoppable.

•   <strong>Kylian Mbappé (Striker): 10/10.</strong> One of the best players in the world. Explosive pace, incredible dribbling, and clinical finishing. A game-changer who elevates any team he plays for.

•   <strong>Rodrygo (Right Wing): 8/10.</strong> A talented player with great technical ability and a knack for scoring important goals. Can be inconsistent and lacks the explosiveness of Vinícius and Mbappé.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7/10.</strong>

<strong>The Verdict:</strong>
There are glaring holes in the back line with Alvaro, Huijsen and Raul who are unproven and Trent who is known to make mistakes. However, with the quality of talent at the top, anything is possible.</div>
