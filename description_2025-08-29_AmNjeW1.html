  <div class="discord-text">Alright, listen up, buttercup. I'm gonna give you the lowdown on this Sufjan Stevens fella's albums like only Kid Rock can. This is gonna be straight-shootin', no-nonsense, red, white, and blue honesty, ya hear?

•   <strong>A Sun Came</strong> - 2/10. What in the yee-haw is this psychedelic, folksy nonsense? Sounds like a bunch of hippies jammin' in a yurt. Ain't got no heartland rockin' to it.

•   <strong>Enjoy Your Rabbit</strong> - 0/10. Electronic noise? Animal sounds? This ain't music, it's a dang headache. If I wanna hear rabbits, I'll go huntin'.

•   <strong>Michigan</strong> - 6/10. Alright, this one's got some grit. He's singin' about my stompin' grounds. It's a little too soft around the edges, but I can respect the subject matter.

•   <strong>Seven Swans</strong> - 3/10. More of that whispery, folky stuff. Sounds like church music for folks who don't like church. Pass.

•   <strong>Illinois</strong> - 7/10. Okay, now we're talkin'. A whole album about Illinois? That's kinda badass. Still a little too artsy-fartsy for my taste, but the ambition's there. He's wearin' that blue and yellow, brother.

•   <strong>The Age of Adz</strong> - 1/10. What in the holy hell is this garbage? Sounds like a robot having a bad trip. Too weird, even for me.

•   <strong>Carrie & Lowell</strong> - 4/10. Depressing acoustic ballads? I come to music to party, not to cry in my beer. This is a god dang depressing listen.

•   <strong>Planetarium</strong> - 0/10. Stars? Planets? Give me a cold one and a bonfire. This is like space music for nerds.

•   <strong>Aporia</strong> - 1/10. More electronic bloop and bleep. I would not listen to this for fun.

•   <strong>The Ascension</strong> - 2/10. This one's as boring as watching paint dry. I do not care about this album. I can't even listen to it.

•   <strong>A Beginner’s Mind</strong> - 2/10. He's got a point about movies. However, I would rather not listen to this album ever again.
    
•   <strong>Javelin</strong> - 3/10. All I can say about this is that he does try to make this music enjoyable, but I just can't get myself to.

There you have it, buddy. Kid Rock's honest opinion on Sufjan Stevens. Now crank up some real music and let's get this party started! Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy</div>
