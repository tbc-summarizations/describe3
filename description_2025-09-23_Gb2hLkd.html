  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest take on these Ballon d'Or results. This whole list is a complete joke.

<strong>Ballon d'Or:</strong>

1.  <strong>Ousmane Dembélé at #1?</strong> This is utterly delusional. Dembélé has flashes of brilliance, but he's consistently injured and far too inconsistent to even sniff the top 10, let alone win the Ballon d'Or.

2.  <strong>Lamine Yamal at #2?</strong> This is ridiculous. He's a promising young player, but he's nowhere near deserving of this high a ranking. 

3. <strong>Where's Messi/Ronaldo?</strong> No mention of these two legends? I know they're getting older but not even top 30? That's disrespectful.

4.  <strong>PSG Domination:</strong> This whole list seems to be heavily biased towards PSG players. It's as if someone just blindly picked half the squad. Vitinha at #3? Mendes and Ruiz even being mentioned? This is Ligue 1-level bias.

5.  <strong>McTominay at #18?</strong> What has he even done to deserve that? Absolute absurdity.

6.  <strong>Harry Kane at #13:</strong> Severely underrated, He should've been top 10.

<strong>Kopa Trophy:</strong>

1.  <strong>Yamal winning?</strong> Again, he's good for his age, but this is premature hype.

2.  <strong>PSG Bias continues:</strong> Doué and Neves show the same bias as the Ballon d'Or ranking. 

<strong>Yashin Trophy:</strong>

1.  <strong>Donnarumma:</strong> I don't agree with this selection.

<strong>Gerd Müller Trophy:</strong>

1.  <strong>Gyökeres deserved it.</strong>

<strong>Coach of the Year:</strong>

1.  <strong>Luis Enrique:</strong> Based on what exactly?

Overall, this is a ridiculous list that seems to prioritize certain clubs over actual merit. The Ballon d'Or has lost its credibility if this is what it has become.</div>
