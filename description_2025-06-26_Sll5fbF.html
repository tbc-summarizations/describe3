  <h1>Description for 250px-Flag_of_Greece.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of those Greek clubs, rated out of 10:

•   <strong>AEK Athens:</strong> 7/10. They've got history and passionate fans, but can be wildly inconsistent. When they're good, they're REALLY good. When they're bad... well, you know. Recent success has improved their rating.
•   <strong>Aris:</strong> 6/10. Another team with a solid fanbase and history, but they often seem to underachieve given their potential. They have a good stadium and atmosphere but struggle to consistently challenge for titles.
•   <strong>Asteras:</strong> 4/10. A smaller club that sometimes punches above its weight. They can be decent but lack the resources and fan base to be a top contender. Pretty unremarkable.
•   <strong>Athens Kallithea:</strong> 3/10. A club that are known for being a smaller team. They are currently not in the first division so that downgrades the club's reputation even more.
•   <strong>Atromitos:</strong> 4/10. Consistently mediocre. They are like the grey paint of Greek football – never exciting, never terrible, just <em>there</em>.
•   <strong>Lamia:</strong> 2/10. One of the smaller teams in the league, they lack history, fan base, and resources. Often seen as relegation candidates.
•   <strong>Levadiakos:</strong> 2/10. They are a team that have been up and down the leagues of Greek football and are now in the second division. The only reason they are not last is because they have appeared in Greek football more frequently.
•   <strong>OFI:</strong> 5/10. A decent team that has a good fanbase, but not good enough to make it to the top. There will be some fans who might disagree with this rating.
•   <strong>Olympiacos:</strong> 9/10. The undisputed kings of Greek football for years. They have the resources, the history, and the winning mentality. They could be even higher, but sometimes lack consistency in Europe.
•   <strong>Panathinaikos:</strong> 8/10. A historic club with a massive fanbase, but they've struggled in recent years. They're always expected to be title contenders, but often fall short. They need to get their act together.
•   <strong>Panetolikos:</strong> 3/10. Another smaller club that usually fights relegation. Not much to write home about.
•   <strong>Panserraikos:</strong> 2/10. A team that has very little history and very little popularity.
•   <strong>PAOK FC:</strong> 8/10. They have a passionate fanbase and a strong team, but often struggle to overcome Olympiacos' dominance. Can be inconsistent, but when they're on, they're a force to be reckoned with.
•   <strong>Volos:</strong> 4/10. A newer team that has a bit of potential but not a club known for being good.</div>
