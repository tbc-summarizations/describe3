  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this utterly predictable Group B performance. Nothing screams "mid-tier mediocrity" more than this collection of teams.

<strong>Wales:</strong> Congratulations on topping the group, I guess? Three wins and a load of draws â€“ thrilling stuff. Promoted to League A, where they'll inevitably get hammered by actual footballing nations. They are the kings of mediocrity. Their attacking prowess is the most boring thing you can imagine.

<strong>Turkey:</strong> Classic Turkish underachievement. Always hyped, never deliver. Second place and a shot at the promotion play-offs is just another opportunity for them to choke on the big stage. Conceding three to Montenegro is a disgrace and they don't deserve the spot in the play-offs.

<strong>Iceland:</strong> Qualification for relegation play-offs. What were they doing in 2016? They won against Montenegro but the losses outweigh anything good they might have done.

<strong>Montenegro:</strong> Absolute garbage. Relegated, humiliated, and thoroughly deserving of their fate. One measly win. Their team has negative mentality. They were the worst.</div>
