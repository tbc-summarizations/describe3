  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these overpriced footballers. Here are my brutally honest ratings, considering both their skill and if that price tag is actually justified:

<strong>La Liga:</strong>

1.  <strong>Lamine Yamal 🇪🇸 (Barcelona) - €200M:</strong> 7/10. Immense potential, dazzling flashes, but 200M is delusional. He's a kid who needs consistent performances and development. The price is just pure hype, inflated by Barcelona's desperation for a new Messi. He's a long way from being worth that kind of money.
2.  <strong>Kylian Mbappe 🇫🇷 (Real Madrid) - €180M:</strong> 9.5/10. A force of nature. Worth it if you absolutely need goals and game-changing ability. However, his attitude and ego can be a liability. The price is high, but his talent is undeniable, arguably the best player in the world right now.
3.  <strong>Jude Bellingham 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (Real Madrid) - €180M:</strong> 9/10. Impactful, versatile, and a leader. He's delivered on the hype and has proven to be worth the price. His work rate is unmatched. Real Madrid are seeing the best of him.
4.  <strong>Vinicius Junior 🇧🇷 (Real Madrid) - €170M:</strong> 8.5/10. Electric on the ball. World-class dribbler and finisher, but inconsistent and prone to theatrics. The price is a bit steep due to his inconsistencies. Can vanish in big games.
5.  <strong>Pedri 🇪🇸 (Barcelona) - €140M:</strong> 7/10. High potential but often injured. His talent and vision are undeniable, but he needs to stay fit. At his current price, he is a risky purchase.

<strong>Premier League:</strong>

1.  <strong>Erling Haaland 🇳🇴 (Manchester City) - €180M:</strong> 9.5/10. A goal machine, but he needs the right service. Worth the price if your team is built to supply him. He's not a complete forward, but what he does, he does better than anyone else.
2.  <strong>Bukayo Saka 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (Arsenal) - €150M:</strong> 8/10. Consistent and creative. He is important for Arsenal, but 150M is pushing it. Good player, but not truly world-class... <em>yet</em>.
3.  <strong>Florian Wirtz 🇩🇪 (Liverpool) - €140M:</strong> 8/10. High potential for Liverpool, and an amazing player but his price is slightly over what it should be. His quality is undeniable.
4.  <strong>Alexander Isak 🇸🇪 (Newcastle United) - €120M:</strong> 7.5/10. A good striker with the ability to score goals, but I wouldn't pay that much for him.
5.  <strong>Cole Palmer 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (Chelsea) - €120M:</strong> 7.5/10. Surprisingly good for Chelsea, good penalty taker.

<strong>Serie A:</strong>

1.  <strong>Lautaro Martinez 🇦🇷 (Inter Milan) - €95M:</strong> 8/10. A proven goalscorer in Serie A, but he disappears in bigger games. His price is quite decent though and reflects his value.
2.  <strong>Alessandro Bastoni 🇮🇹 (Inter Milan) - €80M:</strong> 7.5/10. Solid defender, but not exceptional. The price is a bit high for a player who isn't a world-class name. Overrated because he plays in a good team.
3.  <strong>Marcus Thuram 🇫🇷 (Inter Milan) - €75M:</strong> 7/10. Athletic and versatile, but inconsistent. Not a reliable goalscorer. Overpriced.
4.  <strong>Nicolo Barella 🇮🇹 (Inter Milan) - €75M:</strong> 7.5/10. Energetic midfielder. His workrate and passion is great, but he lacks technical quality and a bit overrated by the club.
5.  <strong>Rafael Leao 🇵🇹 (AC Milan) - €70M:</strong> 7.5/10. Fast and skillful, but lacks consistency and often goes missing in big games. A bit lazy, and that impacts his decision-making. For the price, a risk.

<strong>Bundesliga:</strong>

1.  <strong>Jamal Musiala 🇩🇪 (Bayern Munich) - €140M:</strong> 8/10. Incredibly talented and creative midfielder. Worth the investment for his potential. Although, injury prone, and I worry that he will never meet his potential because of them.
2.  <strong>Michael Olise 🇫🇷 (Bayern Munich) - €100M:</strong> 8/10. High potential and an amazing player, the price would be worth it.
3.  <strong>Hugo Ekitike 🇫🇷 (Eintracht Frankfurt) - €75M:</strong> 5/10. Underperforming. Not worth the price. Can't rely on this guy for the team.
4.  <strong>Harry Kane 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (Bayern Munich) - €75M:</strong> 8/10. Decent goal-scorer, the price is worth the value he brings to the team.
5.  <strong>Benjamin Sesko 🇸🇮 (RB Leipzig) - €70M:</strong> 7/10. High potential, but that's all he has going for him, the price is questionable.

<strong>Ligue 1:</strong>

1.  <strong>Ousmane Dembele 🇫🇷 (Paris Saint-Germain) - €90M:</strong> 6/10. Talented, but injury-prone and inconsistent. Unreliable and a wasted purchase for PSG.
2.  <strong>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia 🇬🇪 (Paris Saint-Germain) - €90M:</strong> 7/10. He is good. but there are better choices that should be picked over him.
3.  <strong>Desire Doue 🇫🇷 (Paris Saint-Germain) - €90M:</strong> 6/10. High potential, but still very raw. Too early to justify that price.
4.  <strong>Vitinha 🇵🇹 (Paris Saint-Germain) - €80M:</strong> 7/10. A decent midfielder, not good enough to be one of the highest valued players.
5.  <strong>Joao Neves 🇵🇹 (Paris Saint-Germain) - €80M:</strong> 7.5/10. Promising young talent, but risky for that price.

That's my assessment. Feel free to ask me to elaborate on any player. These valuations are wild, though, football's gone mad!</div>
