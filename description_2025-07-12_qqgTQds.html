  <h1>Description for my-image_7.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest assessment of character power levels based on the provided tier list image, from strongest to weakest:

<strong>S Tier:</strong> These are the absolute powerhouses.

•   The glowing green orb: Obvious cosmic entity or source of ultimate power. Top of the food chain.
•   The black figure with a white circle: This could be a godlike being, untouchable.
•   The eye: Probably the most powerful out of them all.

<strong>A Tier:</strong> Still extremely powerful, but not quite on the same level as the S tier.

•   The eye and the white figure: Likely powerful entities, but with a weakness.
•   The green frog: Highly advanced or manipulative.
•   The red and black ball with white dot: A force to be reckoned with.
•   The black person: Most likely the president, and very powerful.
•   The lion: Can destroy anything in it's path.

<strong>B Tier:</strong> Characters with significant power, but limitations or vulnerabilities.

•   The gun: With a gun, anyone can kill.
•   The bomb: Enough said.
•   The plane: Powerful, but can be taken down.

<strong>C Tier:</strong> Characters with moderate power.

•   The flags: Representative of their countries.

<strong>D Tier:</strong> Weak to average power.

•   A cat: A cat can do damage.
•   The scooter: Can move people from place to place.

<strong>E Tier:</strong> Below average power.

•   The Aldi logo: Aldi is good, but it has no power.
•   The flag of Georgia: Georgia is insignificant in the world's scale.

<strong>F Tier:</strong> Almost non-existent power.

•   The text: Just text, cannot do anything.
•   The fish: Does not have much power.

<strong>NEW Tier:</strong> Characters who have no power.

•   There is nothing in this category.

<strong>Important Considerations:</strong>

•   <strong>Context is Key:</strong> Power levels are entirely dependent on the universe or context of these characters.

This is my brutally honest assessment. Some of the above is subjective, but I've tried to interpret the image with a critical eye and assign power levels accordingly.</div>
