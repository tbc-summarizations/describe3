  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these group stage results with the harsh honesty they deserve.

<strong>Teams That Overperformed:</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> Top of Group A? Seriously? They looked shaky in their opening match, but somehow managed to grind out results. Let's be honest, they were lucky with their draw against Ukraine. Their two wins were against subpar teams.
•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> This team! Winning Group C ahead of France?! The Swiss, with their clinical efficiency, showed that tactical discipline can triumph over individual brilliance. Their victory over Portugal was a proper statement, showing they're not just there to make up the numbers.
•   <strong>Denmark:</strong> The most impressive performance, no doubt. To win a group with Italy and Croatia is a testament to their solid defense and efficient attacking. They made their home advantage count, suffocating their opponents and securing crucial victories.

<strong>Teams That Utterly Disappointed:</strong>

•   <strong>Wales:</strong> Zero points? Absolutely pathetic. They showed no ambition, no fight, and looked completely outclassed in every game. They were lucky to have scored even two goals. Embarrassing.
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> Three losses, bottom of their group? This team was hyped up, but they completely crumbled under pressure. Their attacking play was toothless, and their defense was a shambles. A massive disappointment.
•   <strong>Italy:</strong> Another team that massively underperformed. They struggled to create chances, and their defense was surprisingly shaky. To finish third in their group is a disgrace.

<strong>Most Surprising Teams:</strong>

•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> As mentioned earlier, topping a group with France is a huge shock. Their tactical organization and ability to shut down Portugal was incredible.
•   <strong>England:</strong> Considering their pre-tournament hype, failing to qualify is a monumental collapse. They were predictable, lacked creativity, and their star players failed to deliver.

<strong>Most Disappointing Teams:</strong>

•   <strong>England:</strong> No-brainer. They were tipped as potential winners, but they completely choked. Their performances were uninspired, and their tactics were questionable.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> A team packed with individual talent, failing to deliver in a weak group is unacceptable. Their reliance on individual moments of brilliance rather than cohesive teamwork cost them dearly.

<strong>Matches That Shocked:</strong>

•   <strong>Germany 0-1 Netherlands:</strong> This defeat set the tone for Germany's underwhelming campaign. They looked disjointed and lacked any real attacking threat.
•   <strong>Portugal 0-2 Switzerland:</strong> A convincing win for the Swiss, exposing Portugal's defensive frailties and lack of tactical cohesion.
•   <strong>Croatia 2-0 Italy:</strong> No one expected the Croats to dominate the Italians this way. A tactical masterclass that left the Italians struggling for answers.</div>
