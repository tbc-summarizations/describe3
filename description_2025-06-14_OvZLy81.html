  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal truth about Argentina's World Cup-winning squad:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Emiliano Martínez:</strong> 7.5. He had some great moments, but his antics and inconsistency at times were frustrating. A bit of a showman, but ultimately a decent shot-stopper.
•   <strong>Nahuel Molina:</strong> 6.5. Solid defensively, but offered little going forward. Not a standout player, but did his job.
•   <strong>Cristian Romero:</strong> 7. A physical presence, but prone to rash challenges. Can be a liability at times.
•   <strong>Nicolás Otamendi:</strong> 5.5. Slow, error-prone, and often caught out of position. How he started every game is beyond me.
•   <strong>Nicolás Tagliafico:</strong> 6. A reliable but unspectacular left-back. Not a game-changer by any means.
•   <strong>Alexis Mac Allister:</strong> 7.5. A workhorse in midfield, but sometimes lacks the creativity to unlock defenses.
•   <strong>Enzo Fernández:</strong> 8. A revelation in midfield. Energetic, skillful, and a great passer. Future star.
•   <strong>Rodrigo De Paul:</strong> 6.5. A decent midfielder, but often overhyped. More hustle than actual quality.
•   <strong>Lionel Messi:</strong> 10. Need I say more? Carried the team at times and delivered when it mattered most. A true legend.
•   <strong>Julián Álvarez:</strong> 7.5. Energetic and a good finisher, but still a bit raw. Has the potential to be a top striker.
•   <strong>Ángel Di María:</strong> 8. A creative spark and a goal threat. Proved his worth in the final.

<strong>Team Rating (Out of 10):</strong>

Overall, I'd give the team a <strong>7</strong>. They were far from perfect, and heavily reliant on Messi's brilliance. Their defense was shaky at times, and some of the midfield players were inconsistent. However, they showed great spirit and determination, and ultimately found a way to win. Definitely not the best World Cup-winning team in history, but they got the job done.</div>
