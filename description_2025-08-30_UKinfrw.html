  <h1>Description for 250px-Arsenal_FC.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of that Arsenal starting XI, based on current form, potential, and how well I think they'd gel as a unit:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: David Raya (🇪🇸): 6/10</strong> - Look, he's decent at distribution and can make some good saves, but he's prone to errors and doesn't command the box as well as I'd like. He's a slight downgrade on Ramsdale for me. He is also not as consistent as he should be with that experience.

•   <strong>Defender: Myles Lewis-Skelly (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 4/10</strong> - A young, promising talent but chucking him into the starting XI this early is just asking for trouble. He's raw, inexperienced, and would be a massive liability against top-tier attackers. Needs serious development and game time before he's ready.

•   <strong>Defender: William Saliba (🇫🇷): 9/10</strong> - An absolute rock. He's got pace, power, and incredible reading of the game. One of the best center-backs in the league when fit and focused.

•   <strong>Defender: Gabriel Magalhães (🇧🇷): 7/10</strong> - Passionate and aggressive, but also prone to rash decisions and silly mistakes. Good in the air and a decent partner for Saliba, but needs to cut out the errors.

•   <strong>Defender: Jurriën Timber (🇳🇱): 7/10</strong> - Solid defensively and comfortable on the ball. Offers versatility, being able to play multiple positions. However, there are better options for him.

•   <strong>Midfielder: Declan Rice (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 8/10</strong> - A top-class defensive midfielder. Breaks up play effectively, has a great engine, and is improving his passing range. He is a great player and will continue to be for Arsenal for years to come.

•   <strong>Midfielder: Martin Ødegaard (🇳🇴): 9/10</strong> - The creative heartbeat of the team. Excellent vision, passing range, and a knack for scoring crucial goals. A true leader on and off the pitch.

•   <strong>Midfielder: Martín Zubimendi (🇪🇸): 7/10</strong> - A good, composed midfielder who helps control the tempo of the game. Solid defensively, but doesn't offer the same dynamism as some other options.

•   <strong>Attacker: Gabriel Martinelli (🇧🇷): 7/10</strong> - Electric pace and a direct style of play. Can be a nightmare for defenders on his day. But he still struggles with consistency and decision-making in the final third.

•   <strong>Attacker: Viktor Gyökeres (🇸🇪): 8/10</strong> - A physically imposing striker with a great goalscoring record. He's strong, good in the air, and has a decent touch. Could be a real handful for defenses.

•   <strong>Attacker: Bukayo Saka (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 9/10</strong> - A star. Skillful, creative, and clinical in front of goal. He's a constant threat and one of the best wingers in the league.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7/10</strong>

Look, there's some serious quality in that XI, especially with Saliba, Rice, Ødegaard, and Saka. But the weak points are very obvious. Lewis-Skelly is a major gamble, and Raya hasn't fully convinced me. The midfield lacks a bit of bite alongside Rice, and Martinelli is too inconsistent.

Gyökeres is a good addition but he's not a world-class striker yet.

This team could challenge for a top-four spot, but they're not quite ready to win the league. They need more experience, consistency, and a better goalkeeper to be truly elite. It is a good team, but is not without its flaws, as mentioned, so could potentially be better.</div>
