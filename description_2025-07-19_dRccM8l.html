  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's dissect Aktobe's (fictional) Champions League campaign with ruthless honesty. 

<strong>League Phase Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Real Madrid (0-4):</strong> A total humiliation to start. They were rightfully thrashed and exposed as amateurs compared to genuine world-class opposition. <strong>Rating: 1/10</strong>

•   <strong>Olympiacos (3-0):</strong> A surprising result, no doubt, but Olympiacos are known to have weak moments. Aktobe likely got lucky with counter-attacking goals and a bit of defensive sloppiness from the Greeks. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>

•   <strong>Gent (2-1):</strong> Beating Gent isn't a major achievement. They're a mid-table team at best. This was a must-win game that Aktobe barely scraped through. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>

•   <strong>Benfica (1-1):</strong> A lucky draw. Benfica likely dominated possession and created many more chances, but Aktobe probably parked the bus and got a scrappy goal on a counter. <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>

•   <strong>Tottenham (0-1):</strong> Predictable. Tottenham's second string team would have been enough to beat this team. They put up a poor performance. <strong>Rating: 2/10</strong>

•   <strong>FCSB (2-0):</strong> A decent result against a historically decent side, however, FCSB are not what they once were, and Aktobe would need to win this comfortably to have any chance of progressing. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>

•   <strong>CSKA Moscow (0-1):</strong> Another disappointing result, with their poor attacking football exposed again. They did nothing. <strong>Rating: 1/10</strong>

•   <strong>Sturm Graz (2-0):</strong> Sturm Graz are dreadful, and their stadium is horrible, the result of the game being a formality. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>

•   <strong>Manchester City (0-3):</strong> Another total humiliation, although better than the Real Madrid defeat. Still a poor performance overall. <strong>Rating: 2/10</strong>

•   <strong>Spartak Moscow (1-0):</strong> Another fairly poor result, Spartak are worse than Manchester City, Tottenham and Real Madrid. <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>

•   <strong>Galatasaray (3-1):</strong> Galatasaray are an okay team, however, Aktobe should be losing this match. They got lucky and played very well against a much better side. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>

•   <strong>Celtic (0-1):</strong> Celtic should have won by more. This was just enough to knock them out of the Champions League. <strong>Rating: 3/10</strong>

<strong>Overall League Phase Rating:</strong>

6 wins, 1 draw, and 5 losses is mediocre. They scraped through to the knockout stage due to lucky match ups, weaker groups, and good luck. They did not do anything remotely good. <strong>Overall rating: 4/10.</strong>

<strong>Round of 32 Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen (1-2):</strong> An expected defeat, but at least they managed to score a goal. They were completely outclassed by a far superior team, and deserved to lose. They should not have been here in the first place. <strong>Rating: 3/10.</strong>

<strong>Overall Campaign Rating:</strong>

Aktobe's Champions League campaign was nothing short of a joke. They were lucky to even make it to the knockout stage, and were promptly dispatched by Bayer Leverkusen. They had some lucky wins against weaker teams, but were completely outclassed by the bigger sides. They are not good enough to compete at this level, and should be ashamed of their performance. <strong>Final Rating: 2/10.</strong></div>
