  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these results with the cold, harsh truth you demanded.

<strong>Quarter-Finals Commentary:</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan vs. Kosovo:</strong> Kazakhstan pulling out a 3-1 win wasn't a huge shock, but Kosovo drawing first blood made things interesting. Zainutdinov stepping up twice proves he's a player to watch, but the early setback shows Kazakhstan can be rattled.

•   <strong>Armenia vs. Lithuania:</strong> A clinical 2-0 victory for Armenia. Ranos and Briasco delivering before halftime suggests a well-prepared and confident team. Lithuania, honestly, were probably outmatched on paper anyway.

•   <strong>Cyprus vs. Faroe Islands:</strong> A 4-0 thrashing! Cyprus clearly dominated, with Artymatas and Laifis bagging braces. Faroe Islands were simply outclassed, proving that passion doesn't always trump talent.

•   <strong>Latvia vs. Estonia:</strong> A tense, drawn-out affair settled in extra time. Latvia had the edge, but Estonia's resilience kept them in it. Gutkovskis and Ikaunieks were the heroes for Latvia, but let's be real, this was a scrappy game.

<strong>Semi-Finals Commentary:</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan vs. Armenia:</strong> A heartbreaking loss for Kazakhstan. Scoring first in both halves is a psychological blow. Armenia's late surge shows their mental fortitude, but Kazakhstan will rue those missed opportunities.

•   <strong>Cyprus vs. Latvia:</strong> A painful 1-0 defeat for Cyprus. Gutkovskis scoring early meant a huge advantage and Cyprus was unable to recover. A bitter pill to swallow for the Cypriots.

<strong>Final Prediction: Armenia vs. Latvia</strong>

Armenia will win and here's why. They've demonstrated offensive firepower and mental toughness. Latvia, on the other hand, has been gritty but not particularly convincing. Armenia's ability to score crucial goals at vital moments will be the difference.

<strong>Biggest Surprises:</strong>

•   Honestly, I expected Cyprus to put up a better fight against Latvia. They absolutely bottled it.

<strong>Biggest Disappointments:</strong>

•   <strong>Faroe Islands.</strong> Getting thrashed by Cyprus, a team that isn't exactly a footballing powerhouse, is a humiliation.

•   <strong>Kosovo.</strong> They showed promise against Kazakhstan, but they ultimately fell short. They need to improve defensively if they want to compete at a higher level.</div>
