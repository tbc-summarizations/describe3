  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because I'm about to give you the unvarnished truth about these Scottish clubs:

•   <strong>Aberdeen:</strong> 6/10. Historically significant, but they've been in a serious slump for decades. They have flashes of brilliance, but ultimately, they're mid-table fodder most years. Their glory days under Fergie are a distant memory.

•   <strong>Celtic:</strong> 9/10. A behemoth. Dominate the league most years, have a global fanbase, and are a financial powerhouse. They often choke in Europe, though, which keeps them from a perfect score.

•   <strong>Dundee:</strong> 3/10. A yo-yo club, constantly going up and down between the Premiership and the Championship. They lack consistency and resources to be a major player.

•   <strong>Dundee United:</strong> 4/10. Similar to Dundee, but slightly more stable. They've had some decent spells, but they're no longer a top-tier force in Scotland.

•   <strong>Heart of Midlothian:</strong> 6/10. A big club with a passionate fanbase, but they've been plagued by instability and financial problems. They're capable of challenging for Europe but often fall short.

•   <strong>Hibernian:</strong> 5/10. Edinburgh rivals to Hearts, they're known for their flair and attacking football, but they lack the consistency to be a serious contender. They occasionally win a cup, but that's about it.

•   <strong>Kilmarnock:</strong> 4/10. A provincial club that's had some decent seasons, but they're generally a lower-mid-table team. They lack the resources and ambition to challenge the bigger clubs.

•   <strong>Motherwell:</strong> 5/10. A well-run club with a good youth academy, but they lack the financial muscle to compete with Celtic and Rangers. They're a solid mid-table team.

•   <strong>Rangers:</strong> 9/10. The other half of the Old Firm, they're Celtic's main rivals and a major force in Scottish football. They went through a financial crisis a while ago but are back to challenging for the title.

•   <strong>Ross County:</strong> 3/10. A small club from the Highlands that punches above its weight, but they're always fighting relegation.

•   <strong>St Johnstone:</strong> 5/10. A well-organized team that's capable of causing upsets, but they lack the attacking firepower to be a consistent threat.

•   <strong>St Mirren:</strong> 4/10. A decent club with a good history, but they're generally a lower-mid-table team. They lack the resources to compete with the bigger clubs.</div>
