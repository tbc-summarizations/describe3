  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these Conference League qualifiers. Buckle up, because I'm not holding back.

<strong>Champions Path:</strong>

•   <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana</strong> 4-2 Egnatia: Egnatia, you were practically begging to be eliminated. Going down by that much to Ljubljana? Embarrassing. Ljubljana, decent job, but don't get cocky. The real teams are coming.
•   <strong>Milsami Orhei</strong> 1-5 Virtus: Milsami Orhei, you are a disgrace to Moldovan football. Losing to a team from San Marino is absolutely unacceptable. Virtus, good for you I guess, you still are not doing anything meaningful in this competition.
•   <strong>Differdange 03</strong> 5-4 Levadia: Levadia, you choked. Differdange, congrats on the narrow win, but don't expect to go much further playing that sloppily.
•   Víkingur 2-3 <strong>Linfield</strong>: Vikingur, you embarassed an entire country. Linfield, your victory is mediocre, at best.

<strong>Main Path:</strong>

•   <strong>Rapid Wien</strong> 4-4 Dundee United (Rapid wins 5-4 on penalties): Dundee United, heartbreak. You fought hard, but penalties are a cruel mistress. Rapid Wien, you were lucky to escape. Don't think you can rely on penalties every game.
•   <strong>Sparta Prague</strong> 6-2 Ararat-Armenia: Ararat-Armenia, you were utterly dismantled. Sparta Prague, this was expected. Don't get a big head; tougher opponents are coming.
•   <strong>AZ Alkmaar</strong> 4-0 Vaduz: Vaduz, did you even try? AZ Alkmaar, you did what you were supposed to. Now show you can do it against someone who might put up a fight.
•   Lugano 4-7 <strong>Celje</strong>: Lugano, absolute defensive shambles. Celje, congrats on the goal fest, but tighten up at the back.
•   KÍ Klaksvík 2-2 <strong>Neman Grodno</strong> (Neman wins 5-4 on penalties): KI, you lost in penalty shootouts to the Belarussian team. Just awful. Neman, decent win.
•   <strong>Riga</strong> 4-3 Beitar Jerusalem: Beitar Jerusalem, another team that collapsed under pressure. Riga, good fight, but that defense needs serious work.
•   Víkingur Reykjavík 3-4 <strong>Brøndby</strong>: Vikingur, what a disappointment. Brondby, better polish that attack up.
•   Hajduk Split 3-4 <strong>Dinamo City</strong>: Hajduk Split, losing to a Dinamo City? Unforgivable. Dinamo City, a good surprise.
•   <strong>Anderlecht</strong> 4-1 Sheriff Tiraspol: Sheriff Tiraspol, you're not the giant killers you once were. Anderlecht, solid win, but aim higher.
•   <strong>Lausanne-Sport</strong> 5-1 Astana: Astana, completely outclassed. Lausanne-Sport, a comfortable win, but let's see you against tougher opposition.
•   Larne 0-3 <strong>Santa Clara</strong>: Larne, you are bad. Santa Clara, do not expect a repeat result in a stronger competition.
•   Aris Limassol 3-5 <strong>AEK Athens</strong>: AEK Athens, congratulations. Aris Limassol, you underperformed.
•   Viking 2-4 <strong>İstanbul Başakşehir</strong>: Viking, get better. İstanbul Başakşehir, a great victory.
•   Araz-Naxçıvan 0-9 <strong>Omonia Nicosia</strong>: Araz-Naxçıvan, what did you even do? Omonia Nicosia, what a slaughter!
•   Ballkani 1-4 <strong>Shamrock Rovers</strong>: Ballkani, another team that failed to show up. Shamrock Rovers, you did what you had to do.
•   <strong>Raków Częstochowa</strong> 2-1 Maccabi Haifa: Maccabi Haifa, a narrow defeat. Rakow, the scoreline suggests improvement is needed.
•   AIK 2-3 <strong>Győr</strong>: AIK, how did you not win this game? Győr, good for you!
•   <strong>Universitatea Craiova</strong> 6-4 Spartak Trnava: Spartak Trnava, get better defense. Universitatea Craiova, nice victory.
•   <strong>Polissya Zhytomyr</strong> 4-2 Paks: Paks, get better. Polissya Zhytomyr, congratulations.
•   <strong>Levski Sofia</strong> 3-0 Sabah: Sabah, embarrassment. Levski Sofia, you need to perform better.
•   Silkeborg 2-3 <strong>Jagiellonia</strong>: Silkeborg, sad defeat. Jagiellonia, keep up the good work.
•   Partizan 3-4 <strong>Hibernian</strong>: Partizan, sad loss, bad defense. Hibernian, way to go!
•   <strong>Baník Ostrava</strong> 5-4 Austria Wien: Austria Wien, bad luck, better performance next time. Baník Ostrava, congratulations.
•   <strong>Rosenborg</strong> 1-0 Hammarby: Hammarby, you are done. Rosenborg, congratulations.
•   St Patrick's Athletic 3-7 <strong>Beşiktaş</strong>: St Patrick, defense needs improvement. Beşiktaş, this is acceptable.
•   Kauno Žalgiris 0-3 <strong>Arda Kardzhali</strong>: Kauno Žalgiris, bad performance. Arda Kardzhali, a great victory.

There you have it. No sugarcoating, just the cold, hard truth. Some teams need a serious reality check.</div>
