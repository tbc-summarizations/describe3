  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest XI using current players from Poland, Wales, Finland, and Estonia. I'm going for a somewhat balanced 4-3-3 formation that prioritizes defensive solidity and counter-attacking potential, because honestly, this team isn't going to dominate possession against decent opposition.

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Wojciech Szczęsny (Poland):</strong> This is the easiest choice. Szczęsny is a top-tier goalkeeper playing for Juventus. He is a major upgrade compared to any other keeper in these four nations.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>RB: Connor Roberts (Wales):</strong> He works hard. He is capable of playing as a wing-back and right back.
•   <strong>CB: Joe Rodon (Wales):</strong> Rodon is a solid defender who has potential to improve further.
•   <strong>CB: Paweł Dawidowicz (Poland):</strong> Dawidowicz is a decent, no-nonsense defender who is good in the air and tackles well.
•   <strong>LB: Robert Gumni (Poland):</strong> Gumni is alright. He is not amazing and does not stand out but he provides something to the team.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>CDM: Ethan Ampadu (Wales):</strong> Ampadu provides steel in midfield. His defensive instincts and tackling ability make him perfect for breaking up opposition attacks and shielding the back four.
•   <strong>CM: Glen Kamara (Finland):</strong> Kamara is the midfield maestro, bringing composure and technique.
•   <strong>CM: Piotr Zieliński (Poland):</strong> Zieliński is by far the most creative player in this lineup. He adds some attacking intent.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>RW: Robert Lewandowski (Poland):</strong> This is an obvious choice. Lewandowski is a world-class striker with an incredible goal-scoring record. Even if he's past his prime, he will still score.
•   <strong>ST: Teemu Pukki (Finland):</strong> Pukki has proven himself as a reliable goalscorer for both club and country. He's not the flashiest, but he knows how to find the net.
•   <strong>LW: Brennan Johnson (Wales):</strong> Johnson provides pace, trickery, and a directness that this team desperately needs. He is capable of beating defenders and creating chances.

<strong>Manager:</strong>

•   <strong>Give it to someone who will keep things organized and disciplined because that's what this team needs more than anything.</strong>

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

This team is heavily reliant on a few key players. Any injury to Lewandowski or Szczęsny would severely hamper the team's chances. The midfield lacks true creativity and will likely struggle to break down organized defenses. The defense is functional but not particularly mobile, making them vulnerable to pacey attacks.

<strong>Tactical Approach:</strong>

•   <strong>Sit deep and defend in numbers.</strong>
•   <strong>Hit teams on the counter-attack, utilizing the pace of Johnson and the finishing ability of Lewandowski and Pukki.</strong>
•   <strong>Hope for set-piece goals.</strong>

<strong>Realistically, this team would struggle against any decent international side. But with a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, they might be able to pull off a surprise or two. Don't expect them to win any major tournaments, though.</strong></div>
