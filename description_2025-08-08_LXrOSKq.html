  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect Getafe's Europa League triumph. No sugarcoating here.

<strong>Overall Rating: 7.5/10</strong>

<strong>Here's the breakdown:</strong>

•   <strong>League Phase:</strong> An impressive and dominant showing. Winning 6 out of 8 games and not losing once is definitely a great effort and a testament to their consistency.
    \<em> <strong>Rating: 9/10</strong>

•   <strong>Round of 16:</strong> This is where things get a bit shaky. Drawing both legs against Estoril and needing penalties to advance is not the mark of a team destined to lift the trophy. They got lucky, plain and simple.
    \</em> <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>

•   <strong>Quarter-Finals:</strong> Decent showing, they proved that they were the better side here against Bologna.
    \<em> <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>

•   <strong>Semi-Finals:</strong> Again, a mixed bag. Losing the first leg away to Stuttgart reveals vulnerabilities. However, the response in the second leg shows resilience and attacking prowess. Still, Stuttgart isn't exactly a European powerhouse.
    \</em> <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>

•   <strong>Finals:</strong> Drawing against Manchester United and winning on penalties is huge. However, Man United was probably underperforming given it's one of the biggest clubs and it's financial background, they had more quality within their team, so Getafe defeating them is huge.
    \* <strong>Rating: 10/10</strong>

<strong>Honest Commentary:</strong>

Getafe's Europa League run was a tale of two halves. They had a very solid league phase that showcased their tactical discipline and clinical finishing. However, as the competition progressed, their performances became less convincing. They benefited from some luck along the way, especially in the Round of 16.

Ultimately, winning the final against Man United is huge. I can't deny that. It was still a remarkable achievement, but let's not pretend they were a dominant force throughout the entire tournament. They were gritty, opportunistic, and got the job done.

They fought when it mattered and did what they needed to do.</div>
