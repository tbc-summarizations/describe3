  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I see that Kairat vs. Celtic second leg shaking out, based on what you've given me:

<strong>Kairat has a serious advantage</strong>. Let's not beat around the bush, Celtic got incredibly lucky to escape Glasgow with a 0-0 draw. Looking at those stats, they completely dominated possession and had more shots, but their shots on target were pitiful. Kairat's team rating being <em>higher</em> despite Celtic's dominance speaks volumes.

Here's the breakdown of why I'm betting on Kairat:

•   <strong>Home Fortress:</strong> Kairat's 100% home record in the qualifiers isn't just luck. They've shut out decent teams convincingly. The Almaty atmosphere will be hostile for Celtic.
•   <strong>Celtic's Blunt Attack:</strong> Those stats from the first leg tell a story. Celtic can pass the ball around all day, but they struggled to create <em>real</em> chances. Three shots on target from 11 attempts is pathetic.
•   <strong>Kairat's Efficiency:</strong> They had fewer chances in Glasgow, but their team rating was slightly higher. That implies they were more dangerous with their opportunities. I expect them to be even more clinical at home.
•   <strong>Celtic's Inability to Adapt:</strong> Celtic is clearly a team that likes to control the game. Kairat exposed their limitations by defending well and frustrating them. I don't see Celtic suddenly finding a new attacking gear away from home.

<strong>Prediction:</strong>

I'm calling a <strong>2-0 victory for Kairat</strong>. They'll frustrate Celtic, defend stubbornly, and score on the counter or from set pieces. I expect Celtic to throw everything they have at Kairat in the final 20 minutes, but Kairat will hold on for a deserved victory. Celtic's Champions League dream is going to die in Kazakhstan.</div>
