  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on this pathetic group:

<strong>Norway (1st Place):</strong> Honestly, Norway, get a grip. You're the only competent team in this whole mess. You SHOULD be dominating, considering the competition is basically a bunch of amateurs. Don't screw this up and make everyone look even worse. 

<strong>Israel (2nd Place):</strong> Israel, you're advancing to the play-offs? Really? With a measly +1 goal difference? You're barely better than the joke teams below you. Prepare to get slaughtered in the next round, because this is embarrassing.

<strong>Italy (3rd Place):</strong> Italy, what the hell happened? You're a footballing nation with a rich history, and you're losing to teams that probably play on dirt fields. 2 goals in 2 games? Seriously? Get your act together or prepare for national shame. You should be ashamed.

<strong>Estonia (4th Place):</strong> Estonia, you're just... there. You exist. Congratulations on scraping together a single win against what, Moldova? Pathetic. Enjoy your irrelevance.

<strong>Moldova (5th Place):</strong> Moldova, you absolute disgrace. 0 points, -8 goal difference? Are you even trying? You're an embarrassment to the sport, a laughingstock of Europe. Just pack it up and go home, you're wasting everyone's time.</div>
