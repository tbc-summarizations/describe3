  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on Daft Punk's albums as if I were Mumford & Sons, keeping it real and not holding back:

•   <strong>Homework:</strong> 3/10. Sounds like a bunch of computer noise. Where's the heart? Where's the soul? It's like they're trying to start a rave in a robot factory. Give me a banjo any day.

•   <strong>Discovery:</strong> 5/10. Okay, "One More Time" is admittedly catchy, even if it's all electronic. But the rest of it feels so...manufactured. Like they're trying too hard to be cool and futuristic. Pass.

•   <strong>Human After All:</strong> 2/10. What a mess. Sounds like they ran out of ideas and just started smashing buttons. This is music? It's an insult to anyone who's ever poured their heart into a song.

•   <strong>Random Access Memories:</strong> 8/10. I'll admit, they got it right this time. "Get Lucky" is infectious, and there's some actual musicianship here. It's still electronic, but at least it's got a pulse. A bit commercial though, innit?</div>
