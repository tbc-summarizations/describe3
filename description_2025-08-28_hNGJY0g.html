  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the Ted Nugent take on Bowie, hold on to your loincloth:

•   <strong>David Bowie:</strong> (0/10) - Sounds like some artsy-fartsy garbage, no real meat on these bones, just a bunch of noodling.
•   <strong>David Bowie \[Space Oddity]:</strong> (2/10) - Maybe a touch of something, but still too spacey and weird. Where's the raw power, brother?
•   <strong>The Man Who Sold the World:</strong> (3/10) - Starting to hear a little grit, but still too much foof around the edges.
•   <strong>Hunky Dory:</strong> (1/10) - Just a bunch of boring piano, no balls to it.
•   <strong>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> (0/10) - Ridiculous costume! Where's the real guitar? Is he trying to look like a girl?
•   <strong>Aladdin Sane:</strong> (0/10) - Just more of the same garbage.
•   <strong>Pin Ups:</strong> (0/10) - Why is he covering other musicians' songs? Just stick to one persons music and don't steal from others.
•   <strong>Diamond Dogs:</strong> (0/10) - What is this even?
•   <strong>Young Americans:</strong> (0/10) - Even more stupid pop songs
•   <strong>Station to Station:</strong> (0/10) - No thanks.
•   <strong>Low:</strong> (0/10) - I'd rather listen to an engine running then listen to that album
•   <strong>"Heroes":</strong> (0/10) - More garbage for the fire
•   <strong>Lodger:</strong> (0/10) - What is that album title even supposed to mean?
•   <strong>Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps):</strong> (0/10) - Is this supposed to be scary?
•   <strong>Let's Dance:</strong> (0/10) - Get off the stage and go get a real job
•   <strong>Tonight:</strong> (0/10) - Is this supposed to be listened to?
•   <strong>Never Let Me Down:</strong> (0/10) - Just stop making music
•   <strong>Black Tie White Noise:</strong> (0/10) - What are you even trying to say at this point?
•   <strong>1. Outside (The Nathan Adler Diaries: a Hyper Cycle):</strong> (0/10) - Just stop!
•   <strong>Earthling:</strong> (0/10) - No thank you.
•   <strong>Hours...:</strong> (0/10) - No thank you.
•   <strong>Heathen:</strong> (0/10) - No thank you.
•   <strong>Reality:</strong> (0/10) - I wish that was reality
•   <strong>The Next Day:</strong> (0/10) - This just in: No one cares
•   <strong>★ \[Blackstar]:</strong> (0/10) - Good riddance.
•   <strong>Toy:</strong> (0/10) - Like the toy I'll throw at the TV.

Bowie was a great musician if you were a girl, but to a real man who can play the guitar this is what he is.</div>
