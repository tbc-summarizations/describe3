  <h1>Description for 121.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Andrey Lunev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 4/10. Inconsistent and prone to errors. He's a liability in big games.
â€¢   <strong>Igor Leshchuk (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 3/10. Backup quality at best. Unlikely to make a significant impact.
â€¢   <strong>Andrey Kudravets (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> 2/10. Probably won't see much game time unless there's a major crisis.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Maksim Osipenko (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 5/10. Decent, but lacks the pace and agility needed against top-tier attackers.
â€¢   <strong>NicolÃ¡s Marichal (ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¾):</strong> 6/10. Shows some promise, but still raw and needs to mature.
â€¢   <strong>Roberto FernÃ¡ndez (ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¾):</strong> 4/10. A bit slow and not particularly strong in the air.
â€¢   <strong>Milan Majstorovic (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸):</strong> 3/10. Likely a squad player, not a game-changer.
â€¢   <strong>Bakhtiyor Zaynutdinov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 6/10. Versatile and hard-working, but not a standout in any particular area.
â€¢   <strong>Dmitriy Skopintsev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 5/10. Average full-back. Won't win you games, won't lose you games.
â€¢   <strong>Diego Laxalt (ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¾):</strong> 7/10. Experienced and can contribute going forward, but defensive frailties are a concern.
â€¢   <strong>Juan JosÃ© CÃ¡ceres (ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¾):</strong> 4/10. Another average defender.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Danil Glebov (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 6/10. A solid defensive midfielder, but lacks creativity.
â€¢   <strong>Luis ChÃ¡vez (ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½):</strong> 7/10. Good passer and can strike a ball, but needs to adapt to the pace of European football.
â€¢   <strong>Daniil Fomin (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 6/10. Consistent performer, but doesn't offer much in terms of flair.
â€¢   <strong>Aleksandr Kutitskiy (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 3/10. Probably won't get much playing time.
â€¢   <strong>Dmitriy Aleksandrov (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 4/10. Another squad player.
â€¢   <strong>Luka Gagnidze (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 5/10. Young and has potential, but still needs to develop.
â€¢   <strong>Bitello (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·):</strong> 7/10. Energetic and can contribute in both attack and defense.
â€¢   <strong>Jorge Carrascal (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´):</strong> 8/10. The creative spark in midfield. Can unlock defenses with his dribbling and passing.
â€¢   <strong>Viktor Okishor (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 2/10. Unlikely to make an impact.
â€¢   <strong>Egor Smelov (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 3/10. Another squad player.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Nicolas Moumi Ngamaleu (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡²):</strong> 6/10. Decent pace and can score goals, but inconsistent.
â€¢   <strong>Arthur Gomes (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·):</strong> 7/10. Tricky winger with an eye for goal.
â€¢   <strong>Ulvi Babaev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 2/10. Unlikely to feature much.
â€¢   <strong>Yaroslav Gladyshev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 3/10. Needs more experience.
â€¢   <strong>Denis Makarov (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 6/10. Can be a threat on his day, but lacks consistency.
â€¢   <strong>Konstantin Tyukavin (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 7/10. Promising young striker with a good goal-scoring record.
â€¢   <strong>Ivan Sergeev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> 5/10. A hard-working striker, but not a prolific goalscorer.
    <strong>El Mehdi Maouhoub (ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¦):</strong> 2/10.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong> 5/10

<strong>Champions League:</strong> Forget about it. This squad wouldn't even make it to the group stage. They'd get destroyed in the qualifiers.

<strong>Europa League:</strong> They might make it to the group stage, but they'd be lucky to get out of it. Expect a quick exit.

<strong>Conference League:</strong> This is where they might have a chance to make some noise. They could potentially reach the knockout stages, but don't expect them to go much further. They are not winning it.</div>
