  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how we, Maroon 5, see these Nirvana albums, brutally honest style:

•   <strong>Bleach:</strong> 2/10. Raw and energetic, sure, but it's like a demo tape. We prefer polished radio hits, you know?

•   <strong>Nevermind:</strong> 9/10. This is where it's at. Catchy hooks, killer production, and it made them huge. We respect that.

•   <strong>Incesticide:</strong> 4/10. Some cool B-sides and rarities, but it's a mess. Not something we'd put on repeat.

•   <strong>In Utero:</strong> 5/10. Dark and grungy. Not exactly our vibe, but it has some interesting moments.

•   <strong>MTV Unplugged in New York:</strong> 7/10. Stripped down and emotional. Even we can appreciate the raw talent and songwriting.

•   <strong>Live at Reading:</strong> 6/10. Energy is insane, but it's sloppy. Not something we'd listen to for pleasure.

•   <strong>Live at the Paramount:</strong> 5/10. Better recording than Reading, but it's still just a live album. We prefer studio perfection.</div>
