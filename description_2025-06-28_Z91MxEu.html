  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on this player's career:

•   <strong>Al Ittihad (2024-2029): 6/10</strong> Solid start. Getting a King's Cup is good, and his stats for a right-back are promising. However, playing in Saudi Arabia at the beginning of his career suggests a focus on money over top-level competition.

•   <strong>Ajax (2029-2032): 4/10</strong> Significant drop in attacking output. Only 8 assists in 143 games? That's not good enough for a modern right back at Ajax. This period feels like a step backward.

•   <strong>Valencia (2032-2033): 3/10</strong> One season with minimal impact. Probably didn't fit in or wasn't good enough. A very forgettable part of his career.

•   <strong>Manchester United (2033-2046): 8/10</strong> This is where he made his name. 652 appearances is a massive achievement, even if his goal and assist numbers aren't stellar. Winning multiple European trophies and domestic cups elevates his status. A long and successful stint.

•   <strong>Samsunspor (2046-2050): 6/10</strong> A respectable end to his career, picking up two Turkish Cups. Shows he still had something to offer at a lower level.

•   <strong>Overall Career: 7/10</strong> A long career with great longevity, especially with that Man United stint. The early years are a bit questionable and he was an attacking liability. Still, the trophies won are what matter. A good, not great, career overall. Solid but far from legendary.</div>
