  <div class="discord-text">Alright, listen up, I'm gonna rate these "Talking Heads" albums like the true Skynyrd brother I am:

•   <strong>Talking Heads: 77 - 2/10:</strong> Buncha nerdy punk rock. Not my taste. Ain't got no soul.
•   <strong>More Songs About Buildings and Food - 3/10:</strong> Still ain't rock and roll. Sounds like the kinda stuff a college kid listens to.
•   <strong>Fear of Music - 4/10:</strong> Okay, this got a bit more interesting. More rhythm, but still too damn weird.
•   <strong>Remain in Light - 6/10:</strong> I can kinda hear somethin' here. It's funky, but not southern rock. Not bad if I'm drinkin'.
•   <strong>The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads - 5/10:</strong> Live album, but still doesn't capture the energy of a real show.
•   <strong>Speaking in Tongues - 7/10:</strong> Alright, this is gettin' good. "Burning Down the House" is kinda catchy, I'll admit it.
•   <strong>Stop Making Sense - 8/10:</strong> That's an awesome live performance, it has the energy. Great visuals.
•   <strong>Little Creatures - 4/10:</strong> Nah, lost it. Too poppy now.
•   <strong>True Stories - 3/10:</strong> What the hell is this? Sounds like a soundtrack to a damn art movie.
•   <strong>Naked - 2/10:</strong> Alright, I'm done. These guys lost their way. Not my cup of whiskey at all.</div>
