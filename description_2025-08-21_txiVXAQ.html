•   Steven Gerrard: 9.4 - Passion, leadership, and incredible all-around ability.

•   <strong>Serie A XI</strong>
•   Gianluigi Buffon: 9.7 - Legendary goalkeeper. Ageless, consistent, and a commanding presence.
•   Paolo Maldini: 10 - The ultimate defender. Elegant, intelligent, and versatile.
•   Franco Baresi: 9.8 - Defensive genius, incredible positioning, and leadership qualities.
•   Alessandro Nesta: 9.5 - A master of tackling, reading the game, and technical defending.

•   Ronaldo: 9.7 - Pace, power, and clinical finishing. Before injuries, he was unstoppable.
•   Diego Maradona: 10 - The ultimate maverick. Dribbling, creativity, and sheer genius.

<strong>Team Ratings (Out of 10)</strong>

•   <strong>La Liga XI: 9.8</strong> - This team is offensively unstoppable with Messi, Ronaldo, and Ronaldinho. The midfield is pure class, but the full-backs could be exploited.

•   <strong>Premier League XI: 9.6</strong> - Strong midfield, exceptional attacking talent, and a solid spine. But, the full-backs don't quite reach the same heights as the others.

•   <strong>Serie A XI: 9.9</strong> - Unbelievable defense, world-class midfield, and two of the greatest strikers ever. Maradona tips the scales.

<strong>Which League Has the Better XI?</strong>

<strong>The Serie A XI takes the crown.</strong> The defensive solidity with Maldini, Baresi, and Nesta is unmatched. Zidane, Pirlo, and Platini control the midfield, and the attacking power of Van Basten, Ronaldo, and Maradona is simply devastating. This team is complete and has the perfect blend of defense, midfield, and attack. La Liga is a close second due to the insane attack, but the defense is just slightly weaker. The Premier League XI is fantastic, but it lacks the defensive and midfield dominance of the Serie A XI.</div>
