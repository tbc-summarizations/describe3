  <h1>Description for 621107_Saleel-Sawarim-R3MIX.mp3</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The clang of swords is a song of pride
And the path of fighting is the way of life
Between an incursion that annihilates the tyrants
And the suppression of a beautiful voice
The clang of swords is a song of pride
And the path of fighting is the way of life
Between an incursion that annihilates the tyrants
And the suppression of a beautiful voice

The clang of swords is a song of pride
And the path of fighting is the way of life
Between an incursion that annihilates the tyrants
And the suppression of a beautiful voice
The clang of swords is a song of pride
And the path of fighting is the way of life
Between an incursion that annihilates the tyrants
And the suppression of a beautiful voice
In it is the might of my religion and the humiliation of the aggressors
So, my people, arise to the path of the courageous
For either a life that pleases guidance

Or a death that enrages the enemies
Or a death that enrages the enemies
The clang of swords is a song of pride
And the path of fighting is the way of life
Between an incursion that annihilates the tyrants
And the suppression of a beautiful voice

So stand up, O Uqayl, to the path of salvation
To proceed together to conquer the heights
And to raise the glory and elevate the forelocks
Never shall we be abased to other than God
Never shall we be abased to other than God
The clang of swords is a song of pride
And the path of fighting is the way of life
Between an incursion that annihilates the tyrants
And the suppression of a beautiful voice</div>
