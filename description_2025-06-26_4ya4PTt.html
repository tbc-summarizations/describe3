  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Group C performance with the honesty it deserves.

<strong>North Macedonia (Promoted to League B):</strong> The clear winners and deservedly so. 5 wins and a single draw, boasting a +9 goal difference? That's dominance. They were clinical in attack and rock solid in defense, conceding only a single goal throughout the entire campaign. A well-organized team that executed their game plan consistently. Promotion is well-earned, and frankly, expected.

<strong>Armenia (Promotion Play-offs):</strong> Let's be honest, Armenia massively underperformed. Scraping by with two wins and a draw against the likes of Faroe Islands and Latvia is hardly impressive. Their goal difference is laughable. They secured that play-off spot almost by default, and I doubt they'll stand much of a chance against tougher opposition. Expect an embarrassing exit.

<strong>Faroe Islands (Stays in League C):</strong> Utterly mediocre. One win against a struggling Armenia is their only highlight. Three draws suggest they can be somewhat competitive, but ultimately, they lack the quality to challenge for promotion. Staying in League C is probably the best they could have hoped for, and it's a fair reflection of their limited abilities. Absolutely unremarkable team.

<strong>Latvia (Relegation Play-offs):</strong> What an absolute disaster. One measly win and a single draw. Scoring just 4 goals in 6 matches is pathetic. A -7 goal difference tells the whole story. They were outplayed, outclassed, and thoroughly humiliated. Relegation play-offs are looming, and I fully expect them to crash and burn. A disgrace to Latvian football. They are truly awful.

<strong>Matchday Highlights (or lack thereof):</strong>

•   Armenia's initial 4-1 win against Latvia promised a decent campaign, but it quickly turned into a false dawn.
•   North Macedonia consistently delivered, dismantling opponents with ruthless efficiency. Their 2-0 victory over Armenia was a statement of intent.
•   Latvia's lone win against Faroe Islands was a temporary reprieve from their otherwise dismal performance.
•   The Faroe Islands' draw against Armenia showcased their ability to snatch a point, but their overall lack of ambition was evident.

In summary, North Macedonia were the only team that lived up to expectations. Armenia stumbled into the play-offs, while Faroe Islands and Latvia offered nothing but disappointment. A truly unremarkable group campaign saved only by North Macedonia's commanding performance.</div>
