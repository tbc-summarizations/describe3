[00:00:00 to 00:00:04]
Hi friends, how are you?
Today I'm going to teach you how to kill your Pou.

[00:00:05 to 00:00:16]
Well, first we have to enter Pou and then we are going to go to the laboratory and the stand.
There we are going to open the potions and we are going to buy the killer poison.

[00:00:16 to 00:00:21]
For 199 coins and nothing, the only thing we have to do is give it to him.

[00:00:24 to 00:00:26]
I'm going to kill them.

[00:00:26 to 00:00:29]
Here, you are going to kill you, get the hell out of here!
Pou?

[00:00:33 to 00:00:35]
What?

[00:00:35 to 00:00:41]
What?!

[00:00:41 to 00:00:46]
Don't get mad like that, man.
Don't get mad like that.

[00:00:46 to 00:00:55]
I already have.

[00:00:55 to 00:00:59]
Oh, wait, who is it?
Who is it?
Pou!!</div>
