  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of those 12 genres, from worst to best:

1.  <strong>Harsh Noise:</strong> This isn't music, it's auditory assault. Pure garbage.
2.  <strong>Brutal Hardcore Death Metal:</strong> Overly aggressive and monotonous. No substance, just screaming.
3.  <strong>Metal Country:</strong> An abomination. Mixing the worst elements of both genres into a sonic trainwreck.
4.  <strong>Neoclassical Darkwave:</strong> Overly pretentious and melodramatic. Trying way too hard.
5.  <strong>Abstract Hip Hop:</strong> Usually just sounds like random noise and incoherent rambling. A waste of time.
6.  <strong>Ambient:</strong> Can be okay in very specific situations, but mostly boring and directionless.
7.  <strong>Pop:</strong> Mass-produced garbage designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Occasionally catchy, but mostly soulless.
8.  <strong>Psychadelic Rock:</strong> Can be hit or miss. Sometimes interesting, often just self-indulgent noodling.
9.  <strong>R&B:</strong> Overplayed and often formulaic, but can have some genuinely good moments.
10. <strong>French House:</strong> Fun and danceable, but can get repetitive and a bit generic.
11. <strong>Soul:</strong> Timeless and powerful. Great vocals and emotional depth.
12. <strong>Jazz:</strong> Complex, sophisticated, and endlessly rewarding. The pinnacle of musical artistry.</div>
