  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these tracks one by one. No holding back!

1.  <strong>"The Creator Has a Master Plan" - Pharoah Sanders:</strong> This song is over half an hour long? Who has time for this meandering saxophone solo? I bet the creator's master plan was to bore listeners into submission.
2.  <strong>"The Glowing Man" - Swans:</strong> Oh great, another Swans epic. I'm sure it's a masterpiece of droning noise, perfect for contemplating the meaninglessness of existence. 
3.  <strong>"Cloud of Unknowing" - Swans:</strong> So, Swans have a thing for long, brooding song titles, huh? The song probably sounds like what it feels like to be trapped in a fog of pretentious misery.
4.  <strong>"Sleep" - Godspeed You Black Emperor!:</strong> Sleep? More like "Put Me to Sleep." I bet this track is just a bunch of build-ups that never pay off.
5.  <strong>"Static" - Godspeed You Black Emperor!:</strong> I imagine this is just the musical equivalent of white noise. I bet it would be great as a sound for fixing a noisy PC.
6.  <strong>"Storm" - Godspeed You Black Emperor!:</strong> I wonder if this song is just a series of cymbal crashes. A real storm of pretension.
7.  <strong>"Frankie M" - Swans:</strong> I bet this song is garbage and that Frankie M should have stayed at the school he dropped out of.
8.  <strong>"Like Antennas to Heaven..." - Godspeed You Black Emperor!:</strong> I hope those antennas are picking up a signal better than this song is transmitting anything interesting.
9.  <strong>"Track D" - Mingus:</strong> This track better not be as scattered as Mingus's mind was rumored to be. Just get to the point, Charles!
10. <strong>"Part III - Pursuance / IV - Psalm" - John Coltrane:</strong> Is this a jazz history lesson or a song? I bet it's technically impressive but about as soulful as a textbook.
11. <strong>"Only Skin" - Joanna Newsom:</strong> Joanna Newsom's voice? More like Joanna Newsom's ear-splitting screech. I hope the "only skin" is not my ears.
12. <strong>"Famous Prophets (Stars)" - Car Seat Headrest:</strong> Another indie band trying to sound profound. I bet this song is full of angst and metaphors that don't quite land.
13. <strong>"Voodoo Chile" - The Jimi Hendrix Experience:</strong> This song sounds great if you are high on LSD.
14. <strong>"The World Looks Red / The World Looks Black" - Swans:</strong> The world looks like Swans needs to find some new lyrical themes.
15. <strong>"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)" - The Jimi Hendrix Experience:</strong> Hendrix on a bad acid trip? Should have stayed in '68.
16. <strong>"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5)" - Pink Floyd:</strong> Shine on, you crazy diamonds, right into the ground!
17. <strong>"Beach Life-In-Death" - Car Seat Headrest:</strong> What is the worst beach life-in-death? Well, probably listening to this song!
18. <strong>"Cloud of Forgetting" - Swans:</strong> Another cloud of something from Swans! How original.
19. <strong>"Last Call" - Kanye West:</strong> Yeah, Kanye's music is garbage and overrated.
20. <strong>"Basketball Shoes" - Black Country, New Road:</strong> Is this another pretentious indie track?
21. <strong>"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (6-9)" - Pink Floyd:</strong> More Pink Floyd, more pretentious nonsense.
22. <strong>"Moonchild" - King Crimson:</strong> Moonchild? Should have called it "Snoozefest."
23. <strong>"Emily" - Joanna Newsom:</strong> If you don't like to hear people screaming then you may not like Joanna Newsom.
24. <strong>"Mortal Man" - Kendrick Lamar:</strong> How can you be mortal and a man?
25. <strong>"All Blues" - Miles Davis:</strong> All snoozes, more like.
26. <strong>"Earthmover" - Have a Nice Life:</strong> Earthmover? Earth garbage.
27. <strong>"Desolation Row" - Bob Dylan:</strong> Bob Dylan has no sense of rhythm.
28. <strong>"Too Long" - Daft Punk:</strong> Too long to make a good song, that's for sure.</div>
