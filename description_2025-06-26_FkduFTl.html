  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the brutally honest ranking of Austrian clubs, based on their current standing and overall impact, out of 10:

•   <strong>Austria Klagenfurt:</strong> 4/10. They're decent, but often inconsistent. Not a powerhouse, just a solid mid-table team at best.

•   <strong>Austria Wien:</strong> 6/10. A historic club with a big following, but they've been underperforming for years. Potential is there, execution is lacking.

•   <strong>Blau-Weiss Linz:</strong> 3/10. New to the top flight, probably gonna struggle. Not a club that strikes fear into opponents.

•   <strong>Grazer AK:</strong> 5/10. Slowly rebuilding their reputation. Passionate fanbase, but still some ways off challenging at the top.

•   <strong>LASK:</strong> 7/10. Have had some good seasons recently, but also show signs of being very inconsistent. A good side, but tend to bottle it when the pressure is really on.

•   <strong>Rapid Wien:</strong> 7/10. One of the biggest clubs, but constantly fall short of expectations. They have history, but haven't won the league for ages.

•   <strong>RB Salzburg:</strong> 9/10. Dominant force in Austria. They're well-funded, well-coached, and consistently produce top talent. The only thing letting them down is the farmers league they have been dominating for years.

•   <strong>Rheindorf Altach:</strong> 2/10. Usually near the bottom of the league. Not much to say, really.

•   <strong>Sturm Graz:</strong> 8/10. Finally a team to challenge Salzburg, but still not quite there. They play good football and definitely have the potential to win trophies, but need to stop bottles every now and again.

•   <strong>TSV Hartberg:</strong> 3/10. A small club that occasionally punches above their weight, but nothing special.

•   <strong>Wolfsberg:</strong> 5/10. Can be good on their day, but lack consistency. Tend to be a mid-table team.

•   <strong>WSG Tirol:</strong> 3/10. Another smaller club that's just there to make up the numbers.</div>
