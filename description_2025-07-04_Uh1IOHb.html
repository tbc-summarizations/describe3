  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a legend from each of those clubs, like you ordered:

•   <strong>Lechia Gdańsk:</strong> Zlatan Alomerović – the Bosnian goalkeeper is a bonafide legend for his incredible shot stopping and leadership that gave the team two major trophies.
•   <strong>Clube Ferroviário da Beira:</strong> Although they have played a very local role in Mozambique football history, legendary players seem hard to come by in the team's history.
•   <strong>Slough Town F.C.:</strong> You could say that their legendary player is their all-time top goal scorer, Johnnie Hughes who made 429 appearances and scored 162 goals for the club.
•   <strong>AC Milan:</strong> Paolo Maldini – The ultimate one-club man, a defensive titan, and a symbol of Milanese class.
•   <strong>FK Atyrau:</strong> Eduard Sergienko - Kazakhstan international who made over 100 appearances for the club.
•   <strong>Mohun Bagan:</strong> Sailen Manna – A legendary captain who led India in the 1948 and 1952 Olympics.
•   <strong>AFC Wimbledon:</strong> Ben Tilney - A legend of the team known for his great tackles
•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund:</strong> Marco Reus – Mr. Dortmund and one of the best player to wear their jersey
•   <strong>Evil football club:</strong> <em>Looks like it's a fictional team, or so obscure that no information is available. Can't provide a legend here.</em>
