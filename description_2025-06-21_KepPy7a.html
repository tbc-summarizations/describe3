  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these midfields for the 2025/26 season. No sugarcoating, just cold hard truth:

<strong>Liverpool:</strong>

•   <strong>Alexis Mac Allister:</strong> A solid player, good technically, but not a game-changer. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Dominik Szoboszlai:</strong> Overhyped. Flashes of brilliance, but inconsistent. <strong>Rating: 6.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ryan Gravenberch:</strong> Potential is there, but hasn't shown it consistently. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Curtis Jones:</strong> Decent squad player, nothing more. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Wataru Endo:</strong> He's a defensive midfielder with some limitations, decent depth option at best. <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Florian Wirtz:</strong> The potential star. If he lives up to expectations, he elevates this midfield significantly. <strong>Rating: 8.5/10 (potential-based)</strong>

<strong>Liverpool Overall Midfield Rating: 7/10</strong> (Wirtz is the key. If he performs, this goes higher. Otherwise, it's just a good, not great, midfield)

<strong>Barcelona:</strong>

•   <strong>Pedri:</strong> Injury prone. When fit, world-class potential. <strong>Rating: 7.5/10 (availability is a huge question)</strong>
•   <strong>Dani Olmo:</strong> Talented player, can score goals and has good vision. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Frenkie De Jong:</strong> Great on the ball, but lacks bite defensively. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Gavi:</strong> Passionate, but lacks the technical quality of a top midfielder. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Marc Casado &amp; Fermin Lopez:</strong> Untested potential. <strong>Rating: 4/10 (each)</strong>

<strong>Barcelona Overall Midfield Rating: 6.5/10</strong> (Too reliant on Pedri being fit. De Jong is good, but not elite. Lacks a true world-class presence)

<strong>Real Madrid:</strong>

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham:</strong> Superstar. A complete midfielder who can do it all. <strong>Rating: 9.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Federico Valverde:</strong> Energetic, versatile, and adds a lot of steel. <strong>Rating: 8/10</strong>
•   <strong>Aurelien Tchouameni:</strong> A proper defensive destroyer. <strong>Rating: 7.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Eduardo Camavinga:</strong> Raw talent, still developing, but immense potential. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Dani Ceballos &amp; Arda Guler:</strong> Solid squad players, but not starters. <strong>Rating: 5/10 (each)</strong>

<strong>Real Madrid Overall Midfield Rating: 9/10</strong> (Bellingham makes this midfield a force. Valverde and Tchouameni provide incredible support and grit)

<strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong>

•   <strong>Vitinha:</strong> A talented player with good vision and passing ability, but lacks the physical presence to dominate games. <strong>Rating: 6.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Joao Neves:</strong> Promising young talent, but unproven at the highest level. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Fabian Ruiz:</strong> Technically gifted, but too slow and inconsistent. <strong>Rating: 5.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Warren Zaire-Emery:</strong> High potential. <strong>Rating: 6.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Senny Mayulu &amp; Gabriel Moscardo:</strong> Raw. <strong>Rating: 4/10 (each)</strong>

<strong>Paris Saint-Germain Overall Midfield Rating: 6/10</strong> (This midfield is disjointed, lacks a true leader, and is filled with potential, not proven quality)

<strong>Manchester City:</strong>

•   <strong>Rodri:</strong> Arguably the best defensive midfielder in the world. <strong>Rating: 9/10</strong>
•   <strong>Tijjani Reijnders:</strong> Not at the level to be a consistent starter for City. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Bernardo Silva:</strong> An incredible player with exceptional technique and intelligence. <strong>Rating: 8.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Mateo Kovacic:</strong> Good dribbler, but lacks end product. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matheus Nunes &amp; Nico Gonzalez &amp; Claudio Echeverri:</strong> Decent players but just squad options for City. <strong>Rating: 5.5/10 (each)</strong>

<strong>Manchester City Overall Midfield Rating: 8.5/10</strong> (Rodri is immense, and Bernardo Silva adds creative spark. However, the depth isn't as strong as Real Madrid's)

<strong>Verdict:</strong>

<strong>Real Madrid</strong> hands down have the strongest midfield setup. Jude Bellingham is the best player on any of these midfields, and he's surrounded by quality and depth with Valverde and Tchouameni.

Second to Real Madrid would be <strong>Manchester City</strong> as they have Rodri. Liverpool can compete if Florian Wirtz is playing at his maximum potential.</div>
