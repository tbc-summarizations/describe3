  <h1>Description for image0.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the roast of those Discord users:

•   <strong>Mindset:</strong> "I am an interesting and unique person who don't give the fuc..." Yeah, and I'm the Queen of England. Maybe try being interesting instead of just declaring it.

•   <strong>AdamMady:</strong> SUUUUUUUMMMMMERRRRRRRRR HELLL YEAHHHHH... Is that the sound you make when you realize you've wasted your life online?

•   <strong>AJ:</strong> "Mens Mental Health Month" Good for you, raising awareness. Now maybe focus on your own mental health and get off Discord.

•   <strong>andrejtb:</strong> Your profile picture says it all. No further comment needed.

•   <strong>BDYT:</strong> "TornadoCraft return is here" So? Does anyone actually care about TornadoCraft? Let it die already.

•   <strong>Finomano5:</strong> Bet your profile picture is the most exciting thing about you.

•   <strong>HappyMan:</strong> "LIL TECCA HAS NOTHING ON ME" That's because Lil Tecca is actually successful and doesn't need to brag about it on Discord.

•   <strong>BerishbaevMadyManOfficialManoYT:</strong> What a mouthful. Are you trying to win an award for the most generic YouTube channel name?

•   <strong>Meethexep:</strong> Your profile picture is as cool as it is cliche. Try something original for once.

•   <strong>Salle:</strong> Oh look, another edgy profile picture. How original.</div>
