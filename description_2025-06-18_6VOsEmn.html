  <h1>Description for 1024px-UEFA_Champions_League.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on each club's chances of making it through the Champions League qualifying rounds and into the group stage:

•   <strong>Malmö 🇸🇪:</strong> 55%. They're a relatively strong Scandinavian side with decent experience in European competitions. However, they're not a powerhouse and could easily stumble against tougher opponents.

•   <strong>FCSB 🇷🇴:</strong> 40%. Romanian football is a shadow of its former self. FCSB has some history but they are inconsistent and can be prone to upsets.

•   <strong>Ludogorets 🇧🇬:</strong> 60%. The kings of Bulgarian football. They have a decent track record of reaching at least the Europa League group stage, and sometimes even the Champions League. They know how to navigate these qualifiers.

•   <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana 🇸🇮:</strong> 20%. Slovenian football is weak. They will likely struggle against any decent opposition.

•   <strong>Milsami Orhei 🇲🇩:</strong> 5%. Moldovan football is dreadful. They'll likely be knocked out in the first qualifying round.

•   <strong>Drita 🇽🇰:</strong> 2%. Kosovan football is among the worst in Europe. Expect a quick exit.

•   <strong>Kairat 🇰🇿:</strong> 10%. The long trips to Kazakhstan can be tough for opponents, but Kairat isn't that great of a team and will be easily defeated in the second round.

•   <strong>KuPS 🇫🇮:</strong> 3%. Finnish football is a joke. They'll be lucky to win a single game.

•   <strong>Shelbourne 🇮🇪:</strong> 5%. Irish football is not strong enough to compete at this level.

•   <strong>Noah 🇦🇲:</strong> 1%. Armenian football? Seriously? They have no chance.

•   <strong>RFS 🇱🇻:</strong> 2%. Latvian football is another example of a sport in Europe that isn't respected. They will fall apart quickly.

•   <strong>Víkingur 🇫🇴:</strong> 1%. The Faroe Islands have made progress in recent years, but they are still miles behind.

•   <strong>Zrinjski Mostar 🇧🇦:</strong> 7%. Bosnian football is rough around the edges. A surprise or two might be possible, but the odds are stacked against them.

•   <strong>Breiðablik 🇮🇸:</strong> 4%. Icelandic football had a moment, but those days are over. They're not making it far.

•   <strong>Linfield 🇬🇧 (Northern Ireland):</strong> 6%. Northern Irish football has been in decline. Don't expect miracles.

•   <strong>Differdange 🇱🇺:</strong> 1%. Luxembourg is probably the worst of the leagues that have a team competing in the champions league. They are unlikely to win a match

•   <strong>Žalgiris 🇱🇹:</strong> 15%. Lithuanian football is slightly better than others on this list, but still well below the level required to make a serious run.

•   <strong>Ħamrun Spartans 🇲🇹:</strong> 1%. Malta is just a joke. They are not making it past the first round.

•   <strong>Iberia 1999 🇬🇪:</strong> 1%. Georgian football is terrible.

•   <strong>Egnatia 🇦🇱:</strong> 1%. Albanian football is not serious and they have a 1% chance because anyone can win on the day.

•   <strong>Levadia 🇪🇪:</strong> 1%. Estonian football is pathetic. It is doubtful that they will make it very far.

•   <strong>Dinamo Minsk 🇧🇾:</strong> 8%. Belarusian football is an afterthought. They'll likely get crushed.

•   <strong>Shkëndija 🇲🇰:</strong> 2%. Macedonian football is very weak. A quick exit is inevitable.

•   <strong>Inter Club d'Escaldes 🇦🇩:</strong> 1%. Andorran football is amateur. No chance.

•   <strong>The New Saints 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> 4%. Welsh football isn't good enough to progress. They are a disgrace to sport.

•   <strong>Budućnost Podgorica 🇲🇪:</strong> 1%. Montenegrin football is a joke.

•   <strong>Lincoln Red Imps 🇬🇮:</strong> 1%. Gibraltarian football is not great.

•   <strong>Virtus 🇸🇲:</strong> 0%. San Marino is the worst footballing nation in Europe. They won't win a game.

There you have it, brutally honest and with zero sugarcoating. These smaller clubs face a massive uphill battle. Most are just cannon fodder for the bigger teams in later rounds.</div>
