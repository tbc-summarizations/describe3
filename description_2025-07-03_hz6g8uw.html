  <h1>Description for 20250703_235507.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's get straight to the point. From the image, it looks like the head of that second bolt is pretty chewed up and possibly filled with debris. This is probably why you're having trouble getting a good grip. Here's a brutally honest assessment and what I'd suggest:

<strong>The Problem:</strong>

•   <strong>Stripped Bolt Head:</strong> It's highly likely the internal shape of the bolt head is worn down (stripped). This makes it impossible for the tool to properly engage.
•   <strong>Debris:</strong> The bolt head is visibly dirty. This crap inside is just getting in the way.

<strong>How to (Try to) Get It Out:</strong>

1.  <strong>Clean It Out:</strong> First, try cleaning out the bolt head thoroughly. Use a small pick, compressed air, or even a small vacuum cleaner to remove any dirt or debris.
2.  <strong>Rubber Band Trick:</strong> Place a wide rubber band (like one from broccoli) over the bolt head, then insert your screwdriver. The rubber band can sometimes provide enough extra grip.
3.  <strong>Bigger Driver:</strong> Try the next size up driver, even if it feels a little loose, and apply <em>firm</em> downward pressure <em>while</em> turning slowly. You've got nothing to lose at this point.
4.  <strong>Impact Driver:</strong> If you have an impact driver, use it. The sharp impact can help the bit bite into the damaged bolt head. <strong>But be careful</strong>, you could make the situation even worse by further damaging the head. Use low speed.
5.  <strong>Bolt Extractor:</strong> If nothing else works, get yourself a set of bolt extractors. These are designed to grip stripped bolt heads. Follow the extractor set instructions carefully.

<strong>Brutally Honest Warning:</strong>

•   <strong>Easy-Outs Can Fail:</strong> Bolt extractors (Easy-Outs) are often brittle. If you apply too much force, they can snap off <em>inside</em> the bolt, making the situation exponentially worse.

<strong>If All Else Fails (The Really Bad Option):</strong>

•   <strong>Drill It Out:</strong> This is a last resort. Carefully drill out the head of the bolt. This will relieve the pressure holding the fixture in place. Be extremely precise.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

The situation isn't great. That bolt looks like it's been abused. Take your time, be patient, and start with the least destructive methods first. Good luck, you'll probably need it.</div>
