  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercup, because here’s the smackdown you asked for on these snooze-fest matchups. I'm not holding back.

•   <strong>Norway 2-2 Belarus:</strong> A tie? Seriously? Norway should be ashamed. Haaland needs to start carrying the team instead of posing for Instagram photos. Belarus, congrats on managing to not completely embarrass yourselves.

•   <strong>Netherlands 3-1 Lithuania:</strong> Predictable. The Netherlands barely broke a sweat. Lithuania, go back to playing basketball, you're terrible at soccer.

•   <strong>Slovakia 2-3 Cyprus:</strong> Now this is a shocker. Slovakia, what were you even doing? Letting Cyprus score three times? Pathetic defense. Cyprus, you got lucky, don't think you're suddenly world-beaters.

•   <strong>Italy 2-1 Austria:</strong> Italy scraped by, but a win's a win. Austria, close but no cigar. Better luck next time, maybe.

•   <strong>Sweden 2-0 Iceland:</strong> Standard Scandinavian affair. Sweden did what they needed to. Iceland, back to your volcanoes and tiny horses. You're not winning any soccer trophies anytime soon.

•   <strong>France 3-0 Kazakhstan:</strong> Expected. France, try playing a real team next time. Kazakhstan, at least you got a free trip to France.

•   <strong>Russia 4-0 Andorra:</strong> Russia beating Andorra is like a heavyweight fighting a toddler. Yawn. Andorra, maybe try knitting instead of soccer.

•   <strong>Belgium 2-2 Montenegro:</strong> Belgium should be winning these games, not drawing. Martinez is overhyped. Montenegro, good job on the tie, but don't get any ideas.

•   <strong>Liechtenstein 0-4 Czechia:</strong> Liechtenstein, I genuinely feel bad for you. Czechia, congrats on beating a team that's basically a charity case.

•   <strong>Portugal 1-0 Slovenia:</strong> Ronaldo couldn't even carry this team to a more decisive victory? Disappointing. Slovenia, you almost pulled off a miracle, almost.

•   <strong>Moldova 1-2 Armenia:</strong> Who cares? Seriously, this match is irrelevant.

•   <strong>Switzerland 1-0 Greece:</strong> So boring I almost fell asleep. Switzerland, stop playing it safe. Greece, get some new ideas.

•   <strong>Finland 1-2 Ukraine:</strong> Ukraine, a solid win, keep the momentum going. Finland, keep getting disappointed.

•   <strong>England 7-1 Latvia:</strong> Finally, a beatdown! England, keep smashing. Latvia, at least you scored, I guess?

•   <strong>Poland 1-0 Azerbaijan:</strong> Poland, good work, but a 1-0 win doesn't impress me. Azerbaijan, go home.

•   <strong>Hungary 1-0 Romania:</strong> Hungary wins, but both teams should be better.

•   <strong>Denmark 1-2 Northern Ireland:</strong> Northern Ireland came to play, well done. Denmark, what happened?

•   <strong>Croatia 2-3 North Macedonia:</strong> Great match with an unexpected result. North Macedonia beat the Croatians, that is something to brag about.

•   <strong>Georgia 2-0 San Marino:</strong> Expected. Georgia, I expect a bigger W next time, San Marino are just an easy team to beat.

•   <strong>Spain 3-0 Wales:</strong> No surprises here. Spain, predictable win. Wales, focus on rugby.

•   <strong>Ireland 3-2 Estonia:</strong> Ireland, close but no cigar. Estonia, you had a fair attempt, but you lost at the end.

•   <strong>Germany 1-1 Bulgaria:</strong> WHAT? Germany should be smashing everyone, Bulgaria had a good game.</div>
