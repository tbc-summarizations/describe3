  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest truth about these albums, rated like I'm back in the 2000s, ready to drop some serious opinions:

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> 7/10. Still weird, still Björk. Some of those quieter moments are kinda boring though. Definitely not as immediate as "Homogenic."

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> 10/10. Total classic. Even in the 2000s, you gotta respect the glam rock god. Timeless.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> 6/10. Way too long. Like, I get the whole "epic" thing, but this is just self-indulgent noise for hipsters. Snoozefest.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> 8/10. Emo, depressing, but kinda cool. A little too lo-fi for its own good. It is a bit overrated, though.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> 9/10. What a voice! Still breaks your heart. Only docking a point because it could have been better.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> 9/10. Damn. This album shows some real skill. The lyricism is excellent, but some moments are kinda boring.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> 8/10. Prog rock is pretty cool, and this one is the best, but it just feels old and boring.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> 10/10. Amazing. This album has everything to offer, and it is incredible.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> 10/10. DOOM is a legend. Weird, awesome beats, and lyrics that are just out there.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> 10/10. Can't argue with a masterpiece. So relevant even now.

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> 7/10. Jazz is cool, but this is a bit much for me. A little too chaotic.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> 10/10. The greatest hip-hop album ever made.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> 9/10. Classic, but "Dark Side" is better. Still a great album though.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> 10/10. Iconic. Prince was a genius.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> 10/10. Ahead of its time. Just a great album.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> 9/10. Incredible talent. Long, but mostly worth it.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> 10/10. This album has everything! Amazing, brutal, and hilarious! The greatest album ever made.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> 10/10. The Beatles are the Beatles.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> 6/10. The singer sounds pretty bad, the album is nothing special. I guess it's good but it's whatever.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> 10/10. Wu-Tang Clan forever. This album is the reason Wu-Tang is famous. Incredible.</div>
