  <h1>Description for 16779.png, 31007.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Given the provided lineups and without any deeper statistical analysis or knowledge of current form, injuries, or tactical approaches, making a precise prediction is challenging. However, we can offer an educated guess:

<strong>Score Prediction: Ordabasy 2 - 1 Elimay</strong>

Here's the reasoning:

•   <strong>Ordabasy's Attack</strong>: Having both Elkhan Astanov and Vladyslav Naumets feeding Everton Moraes could create a dangerous attacking trio. Moraes as a Brazilian striker should pose some serious threat to Elimay's defense, which is not that stellar.
•   <strong>Elimay's Defense</strong>: The defense seems to be quite average. Despite having Rolón, Zhumakhanov, and Odeoyibo. However, it doesn't appear solid enough to completely shut down Ordabasy's attackers.
•   <strong>Midfield Battle</strong>: The midfield appears closely matched. The combination of Căpățînă and Vakulko for Ordabasy will be decent defensive cover, while Elimay's midfield would try to control the game.</div>
