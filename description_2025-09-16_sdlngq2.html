  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this "Most Valuable XI" with the honesty it deserves. 

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Diogo Costa (Goalkeeper): 7/10.</strong> Overrated in my opinion. He's decent, shows flashes of brilliance, but he's not the world-beater some make him out to be. His distribution needs work and can be prone to errors.

•   <strong>Ian Maatsen (Defender): 6/10.</strong> Seriously? He's okay going forward but defensively he is not good enough. Offers little in terms of tackling and is too weak in the air.

•   <strong>Murillo (Defender): 5/10.</strong> He's young and raw, but that rawness shows far too often. Makes rash decisions and positioning is questionable. The potential is there, but he's currently a liability.

•   <strong>Ezri Konsa (Defender): 7/10.</strong> He's a solid, reliable defender. Nothing spectacular, but consistent. Lacks the flair or game-changing ability of a top-tier center-back, though.

•   <strong>Matty Cash (Defender): 6/10.</strong> Overhyped due to his name. Gets forward well enough, but his defensive work is inconsistent and his decision-making can be poor.

•   <strong>Amadou Onana (Defensive Midfielder): 8/10.</strong> One of the better players on this list. Physically imposing, good in the tackle, and decent passing range. Still needs to refine his game, but has the potential to be world-class.

•   <strong>Angelo Stiller (Defensive Midfielder): 5/10.</strong> A tidy player, but lacking the dynamism and physicality needed to truly excel in midfield. Too easily bullied and doesn't offer enough defensively.

•   <strong>Malick Fofana (Attacking Midfielder): 4/10.</strong> Shows pace and trickery, but his end product is poor. Lacks the composure and decision-making to make a real impact in the final third.

•   <strong>Morgan Rogers (Attacking Midfielder): 6/10.</strong> Flashes of brilliance, but too inconsistent. Can create moments of magic, but often disappears in games. Needs to add more consistency and physicality to his game.

•   <strong>Dan Ndoye (Attacking Midfielder): 4/10.</strong> A workhorse, but severely lacking in quality. Offers little in terms of creativity or goal threat. A limited player who wouldn't make the cut in a truly top side.

•   <strong>Samu Aghehowa (Attacker): 3/10.</strong> Honestly, this guy looks lost half the time. Offers very little, weak, slow and has no good end product at all. He's a passenger.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5/10</strong>

This team is a mess. The defense is shaky, the midfield lacks bite and creativity, and the attack is toothless. Far too reliant on individual moments of brilliance, and lacking the tactical cohesion to compete at the highest level. Aston Villa carry this team on their back by the look of things. This looks like a team that will get battered by anyone in any competition. This team would struggle to win any major trophy. They are mediocre at best.</div>
