  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of this player's career, broken down by club and overall:

•   <strong>Yokohama FC (2024-2026): 5/10.</strong> Decent start, but numbers are not outstanding for the Japanese League.

•   <strong>Bohemians 1905 (2026-2028): 6/10.</strong> Showing some improvement in a slightly better league. Numbers are still not exceptional but better than the start.

•   <strong>Beşiktaş (2028-2031): 7/10.</strong> A good move to a more prominent league, and the player delivers a solid goal and assist record.

•   <strong>Ajax (2031-2034): 7/10.</strong> Consistent performance in a high-profile league. The assist numbers are a welcome increase, but the goal rate remains similar.

•   <strong>Genoa (2034-2036): 6/10.</strong> A drop in overall production in Serie A. Not disastrous, but not impressive either.

•   <strong>Real Betis (2036-2038): 5/10.</strong> Similar to Genoa, performance is acceptable but nothing special for La Liga.

•   <strong>West Ham United (2038-2043): 8/10.</strong> A significant resurgence in the Premier League! Excellent goal and assist numbers indicate a peak in their career.

•   <strong>Tobol (2043-2049): 6/10.</strong> Dominance in the Kazakhstan Premier League and Cup but it is a far weaker league, so the stats are inflated. Still, contributing in their later career.

<strong>Overall Career Rating: 7/10.</strong>

<strong>Reasoning:</strong>

The player has a long career with consistent goal-scoring and assist contributions. His peak years at West Ham elevate the rating. The trophies won late in their career in Kazakhstan, while contributing to their legacy, don't weigh as heavily because of the league's lower level. They're a good player, but not a legend of the game.</div>
