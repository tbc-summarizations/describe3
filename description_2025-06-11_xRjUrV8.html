  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on these World Cup qualifying results:

<strong>South Korea:</strong> Predictable. They should be dominating this group, and they did. Anything less than first place would have been a massive disappointment. They have the talent and resources to be much better, and they just barely delivered what was expected. 

<strong>Jordan:</strong> Good on them for making it to the World Cup. But let's be real, they probably won't make it far in the actual tournament. 

<strong>Iraq:</strong> A team that only managed to score 9 goals in 10 matches? Pathetic. 4th round? They'll be lucky to get anywhere.

<strong>Oman:</strong> Barely better than Iraq. The fact that they made it to the fourth round is laughable.

<strong>Palestine:</strong> At least they managed to win a couple of games. Shows what level Palestine is at the moment.

<strong>Kuwait:</strong> What an absolute disaster. Zero wins? More goals conceded than scored? How embarrassing for a team that used to be a powerhouse in the Gulf. They should be ashamed of themselves.</div>
