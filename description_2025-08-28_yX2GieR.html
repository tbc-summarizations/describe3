  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's do this. As Nickelback, here's my brutally honest take on those Radiohead albums:

•   <strong>Pablo Honey:</strong> 2/10. One song. ONE. "Creep". And that's it. Rest is filler garbage.

•   <strong>The Bends:</strong> 4/10. Better than "Creep" but still makes me feel like I'm stuck in some angsty art school. I'll give it a pity point or two.

•   <strong>OK Computer:</strong> 3/10. Overhyped. "Paranoid Android" sounds like a cat being strangled slowly. I can't believe I'm listening to this in the same era as "Rockstar."

•   <strong>Kid A:</strong> 1/10. What the hell <em>is</em> this? Sounds like random noises played backward. I've heard better music coming out of my vacuum cleaner.

•   <strong>Amnesiac:</strong> 1/10. I've only given the first time any of these albums I've listened to a 1/10 but this one deserves it more. It's so forgettable.

•   <strong>Hail to the Thief:</strong> 2/10. Okay, a <em>little</em> more energy, but still depressing as hell. This reminds me of someone trying to be angry but still being whiny about it.

•   <strong>In Rainbows:</strong> 3/10. Still don't get the hype. It makes me go to sleep.

•   <strong>The King of Limbs:</strong> 0/10. I'm pretty sure they wrote this by throwing darts at a dictionary while drunk. Nonsense.

•   <strong>A Moon Shaped Pool:</strong> 1/10. Nope. Just nope. Sounds like a sad whale song. I'd rather listen to dial-up internet.</div>
