  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you want brutal honesty? Here's how these Europa League qualifying matches will REALLY go down:

â€¢   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ vs. Ilves ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡®:</strong> Shakhtar's class is just too high. Ilves is a decent club, but they will get outclassed and embarrassed. Donetsk will win this with ease. 5-0.
â€¢   <strong>Sheriff Tiraspol ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡© vs. Prishtina ğŸ‡½ğŸ‡°:</strong> Sheriff is a professional European Club who know how to grind out victories and Prishtina has nothing. Sheriff wins 3-1 and 2-0.
â€¢   <strong>Spartak Trnava ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡° vs. HÃ¤cken ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª:</strong> Both teams will have some attack quality with many goals in both legs, however Hacken are the better team. 4-2 for Hacken and 2-2 for Trnava.
â€¢   <strong>Sabah ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿ vs. Celje ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®:</strong> Sabah is a mediocre team and they get a mediocre team that they will draw against in both legs, where Sabah wins in penalties.
â€¢   <strong>Legia Warsaw ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± vs. Aktobe ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿:</strong> Warsaw have too much class here for Aktobe and are too good. Warsaw win with 6-1.
â€¢   <strong>Levski Sofia ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬ vs. Hapoel Be'er Sheva ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡±:</strong> Hapoel Be'er Sheva will grind out a win. Levski Sofia are not a strong team and will struggle. 2-1.
â€¢   <strong>AEK Larnaca ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¾ vs. Partizan ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸:</strong> The Serbian side should be favourites for this, but AEK are in Cyprus, so that means it is hot. Partizan wins overall, but it may take extra time. 1-1 in first leg, 2-1 in second leg after extra time.
â€¢   <strong>Paks ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º vs. CFR Cluj ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´:</strong> Cluj are the better and more professional team with a 3-1 and 2-0 score.</div>
