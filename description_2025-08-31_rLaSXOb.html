  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's what I think as Creed:

•   <strong>day/pop:</strong> 5/10. It's alright, but it doesn't have that raw, powerful energy that I crave. Sounds too soft, not rock enough.
•   <strong>night/pop:</strong> 6/10. Little darker, I can feel something real underneath but it's still trying to be something it's not.
•   <strong>mini mix vol. 1:</strong> 4/10. It's... a mix. Sounds like someone fiddling around, doesn't grab me.
•   <strong>A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling:</strong> 8/10. Now we're talking! It's got a groove, a darkness, a real feeling. Finally, something with a bit of edge.
•   <strong>mini mix vol. 2:</strong> 3/10. Lost me again. Random noise.
•   <strong>Mercurial World:</strong> 9/10. This is it! The real stuff. Deep, powerful, emotional, this album really gets to the core. The sound is fantastic, you can hear the passion in it.
•   <strong>mini mix vol. 3:</strong> 2/10. More of that random noise.
•   <strong>Imaginal Disk:</strong> 7/10. It has sparks. This album is a start, it has something. It is good.</div>
