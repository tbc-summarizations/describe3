  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this combined XI is going to be a wild ride of talent disparity. Trying to build a coherent and competitive team out of these nations requires some serious compromises. Here's my brutally honest attempt:

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3</strong> (Because let's face it, you need to maximize attacking potential when your defense is suspect).

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Giorgi Mamardashvili (Georgia):</strong> This is a no-brainer. The Valencia keeper is a legitimate talent, a shot-stopping beast, and easily the best option here.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>RB: Aaron Hickey (Scotland):</strong> While not a natural right-back, Hickey is versatile and defensively solid. The lack of options forces him here.

•   <strong>CB: Robin Koch (Scotland):</strong> Koch is a decent defender, so will be partnered next to a veteran.

•   <strong>CB: Giorgi Gvelesiani (Georgia):</strong> Giorgi Gvelesiani is a great defender from Georgia. His age and lack of mobility are weaknesses.

•   <strong>LB: Andy Robertson (Scotland):</strong> Easily the best player in this combined XI.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>CDM: Rodri (Spain):</strong> The anchor, the metronome, the reason this team has any hope of controlling possession. Rodri is world-class and essential.

•   <strong>CM: John McGinn (Scotland):</strong> Provides energy and a goal threat from midfield, which this team desperately needs.

•   <strong>CM: Martin Ødegaard (Norway):</strong> Creative spark, top vision, and can pick a pass. He'll have to carry a heavy burden of creativity in this side.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>RW: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Georgia):</strong> The one true superstar of this entire exercise. Needs to be given the ball early and often and let him do his thing.

•   <strong>ST: Erling Haaland (Norway):</strong> Haaland's talent is wasted on this team. Expect goals, but also expect frustration with the lack of service and overall quality around him.

•   <strong>LW: Ferran Torres (Spain):</strong> You need a reliable player that has great work ethic and can deliver good play.

<strong>Brutally Honest Assessment:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Two world-class players in Rodri and Haaland, plus genuine attacking quality in Kvaratskhelia and Ødegaard. Andy Robertson is a great asset to this team. 
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The defense is a disaster waiting to happen, with question marks all over. The overall lack of chemistry will be a major issue.
•   <strong>Overall:</strong> This team would get absolutely wrecked by any top-tier international side. The midfield and attack have the potential to be dangerous on their day, but the defense is a sieve. The team would struggle in any major competition.

<em>There are barely any players in the Cyprus league to select for the lineup. I'm sorry to any Cyprus fans, but the best players from your country play in another league.</em></div>
