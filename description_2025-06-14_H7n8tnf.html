  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the most brutally honest and accurate attempt at a decent XI I can cobble together from those nations, considering the limited talent pool:

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3 (desperate times call for desperate measures)</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: Vanja Milinković-Savić (Serbia)</strong> - The only choice, frankly. The rest are utterly unremarkable.

•   <strong>Right Back: Andrija Živković (Serbia)</strong> - Primarily a winger, but Serbia is absolutely devoid of decent right backs right now. He's got some pace and could track back...maybe.

•   <strong>Center Back: Stefan Savić (Montenegro)</strong> - The only truly decent defender on this list. Aging, but experience matters when surrounded by mediocrity.

•   <strong>Center Back: Strahinja Pavlović (Serbia)</strong> - Young and with potential. He's got the physical tools, even if his decision-making is occasionally suspect.

•   <strong>Left Back: Strahil Popov (Bulgaria)</strong> - No one here is great, but Popov at least has experience. Don't expect too much defensive solidity.

•   <strong>Defensive Midfield: Nemanja Gudelj (Serbia)</strong> - Pragmatic choice. He can at least break up play and pass sideways.

•   <strong>Central Midfield: Dominik Szoboszlai (Hungary)</strong> - The ONLY world-class player in this entire selection. Everything hinges on his ability to drag this team forward.

•   <strong>Central Midfield: Sergej Milinković-Savić (Serbia)</strong> - Overrated, lazy, and inconsistent. But still probably the best option we have.

•   <strong>Right Wing: Kiril Despodov (Bulgaria)</strong> - Decent pace and dribbling ability, but utterly lacks end product.

•   <strong>Striker: Aleksandar Mitrović (Serbia)</strong> - Clumsy, but he can score goals. And let's be honest, he's the only real striker we have.

•   <strong>Left Wing: Milot Rashica (Serbia)</strong> - Very injury prone. The best option available, but may not last 90 minutes.

<strong>Manager: Dragan Stojković (Serbia)</strong>- Piksi is a coach and ex player known by his nickname. Serbia qualified very well under his era for the Qatar world cup, defeating Portugal on the way.

<strong>Bench:</strong>

•   Balázs Dzsudzsák (Hungary): For sentimental value only.

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

This team is a disaster waiting to happen. Szoboszlai is the only player who would get into a top-level European side. Defense is shaky at best, midfield is inconsistent, and the attack relies entirely on Mitrović getting lucky and Szoboszlai's brilliance. The only way this team would survive is if Szoboszlai plays like peak Messi and the opposition has an off day. Otherwise, expect a lot of losses and defensive breakdowns.</div>
