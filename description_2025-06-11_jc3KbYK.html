  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my unfiltered take on these results from Matchday 3:

•   <strong>Wales 3-0 Liechtenstein:</strong> Look, Wales, beating Liechtenstein is like a Premier League team celebrating a win against a Sunday League pub team. Expected, not impressive.

•   <strong>North Macedonia 1-1 Belgium:</strong> Belgium, seriously? Drawing against North Macedonia? Your golden generation is turning into a rusty bucket. Step it up, or enjoy the early retirement home.

•   <strong>Gibraltar 0-7 Croatia:</strong> Classic Croatia. The goal difference merchants. But let's be real, beating Gibraltar by 7 is barely worth a mention. It's like winning a race against a tortoise.

•   <strong>Estonia 1-3 Israel:</strong> Israel, finally showing some bite. But Estonia, what happened? Get it together and stop being the whipping boys of Europe.

•   <strong>Norway 3-0 Italy:</strong> HOLY SH*T! Norway, you absolute madlads! Destroying Italy 3-0? Someone check if the Italian players were replaced with mannequins. As for Italy, time to rebuild, or just enjoy the pizza back home.

•   <strong>Czechia 2-0 Montenegro:</strong> Czechia, doing what they should. Montenegro, time to accept your role as the underdog.

•   <strong>Bosnia 1-0 San Marino:</strong> Bosnia, winning 1-0 against San Marino is hardly something to celebrate. You barely scraped by against a team of hobbyists.

•   <strong>Malta 0-0 Lithuania:</strong> A 0-0 draw between Malta and Lithuania? This is a match made in snoozefest heaven. Someone call a sleep doctor.

•   <strong>Andorra 0-1 England:</strong> England, struggling to beat Andorra 1-0? Someone check if Southgate is still the manager. You should be steamrolling these teams.

•   <strong>Austria 2-1 Romania:</strong> Austria, a decent win. Romania, still hanging in there. A battle of the almost-rans.

•   <strong>Finland 0-2 Netherlands:</strong> Netherlands, a solid win. Finland, back to your saunas.

•   <strong>Albania 0-0 Serbia:</strong> Albania and Serbia, playing to a 0-0 draw. More drama off the pitch than on it, I bet.

Overall, a mixed bag of expected results and a few shockers. Some teams need to seriously re-evaluate their life choices.</div>
