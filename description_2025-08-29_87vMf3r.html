  <h1>Description for 81.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here’s my unfiltered take on this hypothetical Kazakhstan XI:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Mukhammedzhan Seisen (Panathinaikos):</strong> 5/10. Okay, Panathinaikos is a decent club, but he's probably not their star player, he is Kazakhstan's keeper so will have to do better than just average. Still decent enough.

•   <strong>Yan Vorogovskiy (Club Brugge):</strong> 6/10. Brugge is a good stepping stone, but Vorogovskiy likely isn't a world-beater. I'm guessing he will be a decent defender but nothing special, still not the worst player ever!

•   <strong>Nuraly Alip (Monaco):</strong> 7/10. Playing for Monaco in Ligue 1 is respectable. Still, let's be real, he's probably not a rock-solid starter for them.

•   <strong>Alibek Kasym (Sparta Prague):</strong> 6/10. Sparta Prague is alright. I'd expect him to be a solid, consistent player.

•   <strong>Sultanbek Astanov (Legia Warsaw):</strong> 6/10. Legia Warsaw is a decent team for European football and he will be a decent defender but nothing more.

•   <strong>Bakhtiyar Zainutdinov (Beşiktaş):</strong> 7/10. Beşiktaş is a good club in a competitive league. He's probably one of the better players in this squad.

•   <strong>Ramazan Orazov (Copenhagen):</strong> 6/10. Copenhagen is a decent team, but nothing amazing. Ramazan will have to do a little better than average if he wants to play in this team.

•   <strong>Galymzhan Kenzhebek (Slovan Bratislava):</strong> 5/10. Slovan Bratislava is alright and he will be a decent forward.

•   <strong>Dastan Satpaev (Chelsea):</strong> 9/10. IF HE ACTUALLY PLAYS AT CHELSEA THIS IS A MASSIVE BOOST. Even if he isn't playing much, being at Chelsea means he will be training with some of the best players in the world.

•   <strong>Maksim Samorodov (Shakhtar Donetsk):</strong> 6/10. Shakhtar Donetsk is a decent team for European football and he will be a decent forward.

•   <strong>Islam Chesnokov (Celtic):</strong> 7/10. Celtic is a good club in a competitive league. He's probably one of the better players in this squad.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

Overall: 6/10.
This team is mediocre at best. It would not even be winning against the likes of some of the best club teams but may get the odd win against the lower teams. With Dastan Satpaev, the team becomes significantly better. They are very weak at defending. They have some decent forwards but nothing too special. Also, the midfield is nothing to go crazy about. Overall, they are a slightly above-average team.</div>
