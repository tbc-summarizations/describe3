  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League A knockout stage:

<strong>Quarter-finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Italy vs. Germany:</strong> Italy, you pathetic excuses for a national team! You managed a draw in the second leg only because of a late penalty? Embarrassing. Germany, at least you showed some competence, but blowing a lead like that isn't worthy of praise either. Overall, a sloppy tie.
•   <strong>Denmark vs. Portugal:</strong> Denmark, a brief glimmer of hope with that first-leg win, but then you completely crumbled in the second leg. Predictable collapse. Portugal, Ronaldo is your saving grace! Imagine needing extra time to beat Denmark. Disgraceful.
•   <strong>Netherlands vs. Spain:</strong> Netherlands, you blew it in the penalty shootout. Spain, you barely scraped through, relying on penalties. The fact that you needed a 103' goal to even get to that stage is ridiculous. Both teams performed mediocrely.
•   <strong>Croatia vs. France:</strong> France, struggling against Croatia? You needed penalties to overcome them? Pathetic! Croatia, you actually put up a fight, but losing on penalties is still a failure. France, you looked so awful that they almost managed a draw against you.

<strong>Semi-finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Germany vs. Portugal:</strong> Germany, you had the lead and couldn't hold on? Pitiful. Portugal, relying on Ronaldo again. Spain vs. France, this was probably the game of the tournament. So many goals and lead changes. What a performance by Yamal! What a disaster by Mbappé!

<strong>Third-place play-off:</strong>

•   <strong>Germany vs. France:</strong> Germany, you didn't even bother showing up? A 2-0 loss to France? Utterly embarrassing. France, congratulations on securing third place against a team that gave up before kickoff. Not much of an achievement.

<strong>Final:</strong>

•   <strong>Portugal vs. Spain:</strong> Portugal wins 5-3 after penalties. Ronaldo delivers when it matters. Spain gets dominated by Ronaldo.

<strong>Overall Tournament:</strong>

This Nations League knockout stage was a mixed bag of mediocre performances and a few exciting moments. Many big teams underperformed, with penalties deciding too many ties. Portugal, you're the least bad team in the competition. Everyone else should be ashamed of themselves. The games of the tournament were Germany vs. Portugal and Portugal vs. Spain (Final).</div>
