  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest assessment of Kairat's Champions League campaign:

<strong>League Phase Matches:</strong>

•   <strong>Kairat 1-0 Barcelona:</strong> Massive fluke. Barcelona clearly underestimated them. 2/10.
•   <strong>Basel 2-1 Kairat:</strong> Reality sets in. Kairat's limitations exposed against a competent team. 3/10.
•   <strong>Kairat 2-1 Copenhagen:</strong> A lucky home win against a mediocre side. 4/10
•   <strong>Lyon 0-3 Kairat:</strong> Complete and utter shocker, Lyon must have been asleep at the wheel, even so, good job from Kairat. 7/10
•   <strong>Kairat 0-1 Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> Damage limitation. At least they kept the score respectable. 5/10.
•   <strong>APOEL 0-2 Kairat:</strong> Beating APOEL is not an achievement. Expected win. 4/10.
•   <strong>Kairat 1-0 Dynamo Moscow:</strong> A hard-fought victory, but Dynamo Moscow are not the force they once were. 5/10.
•   <strong>Lille 4-2 Kairat:</strong> Humiliating away defeat. Kairat showed their true level. 2/10.
•   <strong>Kairat 3-1 Real Madrid:</strong> Another fluke. Real Madrid was probably fielding their youth team. 3/10.
•   <strong>Olympiacos 2-0 Kairat:</strong> Another loss to a team, showing their limitations, they should just be playing in Kazakhstan. 1/10.
•   <strong>Kairat 3-1 Gent:</strong> A meaningless win against a Belgian team they were expected to beat. 4/10.
•   <strong>Benfica 0-1 Kairat:</strong> Pure luck. Benfica probably had an off day. 3/10.

<strong>Overall League Phase Rating:</strong>

Kairat somehow scraped their way through to the knockouts, but that was more down to luck and other teams underperforming. Their results were incredibly inconsistent, and they were thoroughly outplayed in several matches. <strong>Overall, 3/10.</strong>

<strong>Knockout Stage:</strong>

•   <strong>Round of 32: Kairat 1-1 Lyon (5-4 on penalties):</strong> Penalties are a lottery. They didn't deserve to win. 4/10.
•   <strong>Round of 16: Bayern Munich 0-1 Kairat:</strong> Massive upset. Bayern were clearly complacent. 6/10.
•   <strong>Quarter-finals: Kairat 0-3 Monaco:</strong> Reality check. Monaco exposed their weaknesses. 1/10.

<strong>Overall Campaign Rating:</strong>

Kairat had a few lucky wins and benefited from other teams' complacency. They were completely outclassed by better teams and ultimately didn't deserve to make it as far as they did. Their overall campaign was a fluke. <strong>2/10</strong></div>
