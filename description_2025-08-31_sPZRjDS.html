  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's rank these Kate Bush albums like I'm Shania Twain, here we go:

•   <strong>The Kick Inside:</strong> 6/10. It's got some catchy tunes, but it feels a bit too young and innocent for my taste. Needs more "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" energy.

•   <strong>Lionheart:</strong> 4/10. Honey, this one's kinda all over the place. It's like she's trying too hard to be quirky. Not my cup of tea.

•   <strong>Never for Ever:</strong> 7/10. Now we're talking! This one has some real bangers. It's got a bit of an edge, and I like that.

•   <strong>The Dreaming:</strong> 2/10. Woof, this is rough. It's like a bad dream I can't wake up from. Too weird for me, even for art's sake.

•   <strong>Hounds of Love:</strong> 9/10. Yes queen! This is the Kate I love. Bold, powerful, and full of hits. This is a must-listen.

•   <strong>The Sensual World:</strong> 8/10. Getting better all the time. I really like the vibe she brings. I love it!

•   <strong>The Red Shoes:</strong> 6/10. Catchy but it doesn't stand out compared to others.

•   <strong>Aerial:</strong> 7/10. This is a bit long but it's still got some sparkle. Love the artistic risks, though.

•   <strong>Director's Cut:</strong> 3/10. Okay. This is pretty bad.

•   <strong>50 Words for Snow:</strong> 1/10. Just awful. The album name makes no sense to me.

•   <strong>Before the Dawn:</strong> 5/10. Pretty decent but not my favourite to be honest.</div>
