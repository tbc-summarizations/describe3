  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down the chances of each of these clubs making it to the UEFA Europa League group stage, pulling no punches.

•   <strong>Utrecht 🇳🇱:</strong> 65%. Utrecht is a solid Eredivisie team. They've got a decent squad, a good coach, and the benefit of playing in a competitive league. However, they can be inconsistent, and their defensive record isn't always stellar. They have a decent chance but will need to avoid complacency.

•   <strong>Braga 🇵🇹:</strong> 80%. Braga is typically a strong contender in Portugal. They have a track record of performing well in European competitions. Their experience and squad quality give them a significant edge. However, complacency and overconfidence can sometimes be their downfall.

•   <strong>Anderlecht 🇧🇪:</strong> 70%. Anderlecht is a historic club with a decent reputation. They've had some ups and downs recently, but they generally have a squad capable of competing at this level. Their chances depend on how well they've rebuilt and integrated any new players.

•   <strong>Beşiktaş 🇹🇷:</strong> 85%. Beşiktaş is a strong team with a passionate fan base. Turkish teams usually have a strong home advantage. Their experience in European competitions gives them a significant edge. However, the pressure to perform can sometimes get to them.

•   <strong>Baník Ostrava 🇨🇿:</strong> 30%. Baník Ostrava is a decent team in the Czech league, but they lack the squad depth and experience to make a deep run in the Europa League. Their chances are relatively slim unless they get favorable draws and play exceptionally well.

•   <strong>Hibernian 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 25%. Hibernian is a decent Scottish team, but they are often overshadowed by Celtic and Rangers. Their chances of making the group stage are low, given the competition. They lack the overall quality and experience needed to consistently win against tougher opponents.

•   <strong>Lugano 🇨🇭:</strong> 20%. Lugano is a smaller club from Switzerland. Their chances are quite slim given the competition. Swiss clubs often struggle in the later stages of European competitions due to a lack of resources and squad depth.

•   <strong>Midtjylland 🇩🇰:</strong> 55%. Midtjylland is a well-run club from Denmark. They have a reputation for being tactically astute and developing young talent. They are a tough team, but their relatively smaller budget and squad might limit their chances against bigger clubs.</div>
