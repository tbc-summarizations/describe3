  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because this lineup is going to be a wild ride of mediocre to decent talent sprinkled with some, let's just say, character. We're going for a 4-4-2 formation because, frankly, that's the only way we can even attempt to cover the gaping holes in certain positions.

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Samir Handanović (Slovenia):</strong> Despite being past his prime, Handanović is still the most competent option by a mile. His experience and shot-stopping ability, even diminished, are desperately needed.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Back:</strong> <strong>Joakim Mæhle (Denmark):</strong> Mæhle is shoved to RB since he's at least pacey and has some attacking instincts.

•   <strong>Center Back:</strong> <strong>Simon Kjær (Denmark):</strong> Kjær is our rock. A leader, experienced, and still capable of a decent tackle. Without him, we'd be truly doomed.

•   <strong>Center Back:</strong> <strong>Enea Mihaj (Finland):</strong> Lacks consistency but the lack of quality in the other teams leave him as the second best option

•   <strong>Left Back:</strong> <strong>Daniel Høegh (Denmark):</strong> Solid and consistent is all you can ask for.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Midfielder:</strong> <strong>Christian Eriksen (Denmark):</strong> Eriksen, when fit, is the only genuinely world-class player in this entire squad. He'll need to carry the creative burden, but his passing range and vision are crucial.

•   <strong>Central Midfielder:</strong> <strong>Pierre-Emile Højbjerg (Denmark):</strong> A hard-working, ball-winning midfielder. His tenacity and ability to break up play will provide much-needed support.

•   <strong>Central Midfielder:</strong> <strong>Tim Sparv (Finland):</strong> A veteran player with grit

•   <strong>Left Midfielder:</strong> <strong>Benjamin Källman (Finland):</strong> Lack of any better choices

<strong>Forwards:</strong>

•   <strong>Striker:</strong> <strong>Rasmus Højlund (Denmark):</strong> Young and full of potential. Let's just hope he can deliver on the promise

•   <strong>Striker:</strong> <strong>Andraž Šporar (Slovenia):</strong> A decent finisher.

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

•   <strong>Defense:</strong> Patchy at best. Kjær is the only reliable player. The fullbacks will be constantly exposed, and we'll be relying on last-ditch tackles and prayers.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> Eriksen and Højbjerg can control games, but the lack of quality from the wingers will make it tough to get the ball forward consistently.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> The Højlund, Šporar duo has potential, but they'll be feeding off scraps. We'll need moments of brilliance and a whole lot of luck.
•   <strong>Overall:</strong> This team will struggle against anyone with a pulse. The defense is shaky, the midfield lacks depth, and the attack is reliant on a few individuals. We'll be parking the bus and praying for a 0-0 draw. Realistically, we're looking at a series of frustrating defeats.</div>
