  <div class="discord-text">Okay, based on this lineup, I'd pick Fanny to rejoin Battle for BFDI. Here's why:

•   <strong>Potential for Conflict/Comedy:</strong> Fanny's constant negativity and hatred of everything create opportunities for hilarious interactions and conflicts within the team. This can lead to engaging storylines and comedic moments.
•   <strong>Unique Personality:</strong> Fanny's a standout character due to her distinct personality. It sets her apart from other characters who might be more generic.
•   <strong>Unpredictability:</strong> You never know what Fanny is going to say or do, which makes her unpredictable and exciting to watch.
•   <strong>Room for Development:</strong> There's potential to explore why Fanny is so angry and if she's capable of change or finding happiness. It would add depth to her character.

While some of the other characters have their appeal (like Rocky's vomiting or Woody's fear), Fanny's presence brings a unique dynamic that can significantly impact the show's humor and plot.</div>
