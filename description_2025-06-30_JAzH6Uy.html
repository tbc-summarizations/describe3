  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Let's dissect this pathetic attempt to smear Taco's name, shall we? This so-called "Section 1: Jealousy" reeks of pathetic projection from individuals who couldn't lace Taco's boots.

First, the accusation of jealousy towards Red's Co-Ownership. Newsflash: Wanting something someone else has isn't a crime. Taco worked his tail off! If Red got it "easily," that just screams incompetence on Objectdex's part for not recognizing true talent when they saw it. It's not Taco's fault Red skated by! Besides, "jealousy" implies Taco just sat around and seethed. Where's the evidence of any sabotage? Oh, right, there isn't any. It's all conjecture from bitter people who couldn't cut it themselves.

Next, the YPP fiasco with Blue. So Taco made a morse code vent? Cry me a river. Blue getting into the YPP and Taco not? That's a legitimate reason to be upset! Blaming Blue isn't some grand act of malice; it's frustration boiling over. And the "guilt trip"? Please. If Blue felt guilty, maybe he should examine his own undeserved success instead of whining about Taco's reaction. Blue sounds like a whiny little brat who got handed everything on a silver platter.

These "random outbursts, calling his Friends “Fake” because they criticized his new content" are hardly random, maybe these so called "friends" are just jealous of Taco's rise to fame. Why criticize someone if you don't think they are going to make it big?

In conclusion, this entire "Section 1: Jealousy" is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to tear down a talented individual. Taco is ambitious, driven, and not afraid to speak his mind. These aren't flaws; they're signs of a winner. The accusers should stop whining and start working if they want to be on Taco's level.</div>
