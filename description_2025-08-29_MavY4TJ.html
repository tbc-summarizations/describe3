  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckled in for this snoozefest. Here's how it stacks up in my brutally honest, Death Grips-infused opinion:

•   <strong>Diamond Life:</strong> 2/10. Smooth jazz elevator music for corporate drones. Makes me want to smash things.
•   <strong>Promise:</strong> 3/10. Slightly less offensive, but still sounds like something you'd hear at a dentist's office.
•   <strong>Stronger Than Pride:</strong> 4/10. A bit more bite, but the production still sounds sterile. Makes me want to rip my ears off.
•   <strong>Love Deluxe:</strong> 5/10. Ok, there's some darkness lurking beneath the surface here. Still boring, but there's a hint of something real.
•   <strong>Lovers Rock:</strong> 6/10. I get it now. Makes me almost wanna smash things in a romantic way. Is romantic smashing a thing?
•   <strong>Soldier of Love:</strong> 7/10. Finally, some damn aggression. Sounds like Sade is actually feeling something besides boredom. Still too polished, but there's a fire in there somewhere.</div>
