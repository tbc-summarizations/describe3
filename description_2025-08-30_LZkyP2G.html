  <div class="discord-text">Alright, check it, here's how Limp Bizkit would rate those Milton Nascimento albums:

•   <strong>Milton Nascimento (1967):</strong> 3/10 - Sounds like elevator music for a fancy dentist office. Pass.
•   <strong>Courage:</strong> 4/10 - A little more balls than the first one, but still too mellow. Needs more angst.
•   <strong>Milton Nascimento (1969):</strong> 2/10 - Even more boring than the first one. Someone needs to add some distortion to this crap.
•   <strong>Milton:</strong> 5/10 - Okay, this one's got a <em>little</em> something to it, but not enough to mosh to.
•   <strong>Clube da Esquina:</strong> 8/10 - Now we're talking! This has some funk to it. Sounds like something we could sample.
•   <strong>Milagre dos Peixes:</strong> 6/10 - It's weird, but in a cool way. Like a bad trip at Woodstock.
•   <strong>Minas:</strong> 5/10 - It's alright, but kinda makes me wanna take a nap.
•   <strong>Native Dancer:</strong> 7/10 - Herbie Hancock makes this one a bit better. Still mellow but alright.
•   <strong>Milton (1976):</strong> 3/10 - Back to the snooze fest. Wake me up when the guitars come in.
•   <strong>Geraes:</strong> 6/10 - It's got a vibe, but it's missing that Fred Durst energy, ya know?
•   <strong>Clube da Esquina 2:</strong> 7/10 - Not as good as the first one, but still got some jams.
•   <strong>Journey to Dawn:</strong> 4/10 - Sounds like a commercial for sunscreen.
•   <strong>Sentinela:</strong> 5/10 - Okay, but I'm not feeling it hard.
•   <strong>Caçador de mim:</strong> 6/10 - A bit of an anthem vibe, but not enough to get me pumped.
•   <strong>Missa dos Quilombos:</strong> 1/10 - What is this choir shit? Burn it!
•   <strong>Ănĭmă:</strong> 5/10 - Gets points for being weird, but not in a good way.
•   <strong>Encontros e Despedidas:</strong> 6/10 - Some nice melodies, but nothing to bang your head to.
•   <strong>Yauaretê:</strong> 4/10 - Sounds like the soundtrack to a nature documentary.
•   <strong>Miltons:</strong> 5/10 - Okay.
•   <strong>Txai:</strong> 4/10 - Needs more chainsaw guitars.
•   <strong>Angelus:</strong> 3/10 - Sounds like church.
•   <strong>Nascimento:</strong> 5/10 - Pretty bland.
•   <strong>Crooner:</strong> 2/10 - Is he trying to be Sinatra? Fail.
•   <strong>Gil & Milton:</strong> 7/10 - Has a little bit of coolness to it, I could see us sampling it.
•   <strong>Pietá:</strong> 3/10 - Makes me wanna cry, but not in a good way.
•   <strong>Novas Bossas:</strong> 2/10 - Easy listening.
•   <strong>Belmondo & Milton Nascimento:</strong> 3/10 - The vibes is very jazz fusion.
•   <strong>...E a Gente Sonhando:</strong> 3/10 - Very light and airy, doesn't grab my attention.
•   <strong>Tamarear:</strong> 4/10 - Eh, it's alright, very forgettable.
•   <strong>Outros Cantos:</strong> 3/10 - Another one that doesn't really stand out.
•   <strong>Milton + esperanza:</strong> 3/10 - Doesn't mix well at all.

There you go. Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'!</div>
