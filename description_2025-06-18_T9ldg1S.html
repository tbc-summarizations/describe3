  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest assessment of each team's chances of making it to the UEFA Champions League group stage, considering their history, squad quality, and potential opponents:

•   <strong>Copenhagen 🇩🇰: 65%</strong> - They've been there before and are the strongest team in Denmark. They know how to navigate these qualifiers, but can get a tough draw.

•   <strong>Maccabi Tel Aviv 🇮🇱: 40%</strong> - They have a decent squad and experience, but Israeli football is simply not that strong. They have a puncher's chance but I wouldn't bet on it.

•   <strong>Dynamo Kyiv 🇺🇦: 55%</strong> - The war and all the turmoil makes it hard for them to compete. But I respect what they are able to do. This is a good Ukrainian team with quality players. Still, the instability and lack of consistent high-level play due to the war will be their undoing.

•   <strong>Red Star Belgrade 🇷🇸: 70%</strong> - Red Star should be able to make it to the Champions League. I will be shocked if they don't make it.

•   <strong>Rijeka 🇭🇷: 25%</strong> - Croatian teams are tricky and scrappy, but Rijeka lacks the financial muscle and historical pedigree. An uphill battle.

•   <strong>Lech Poznań 🇵🇱: 30%</strong> - Polish football is improving, but Lech Poznań is still not at the level of regular Champions League participants. They will be a tricky opponent, but they lack the talent and experience to go the distance.

•   <strong>Pafos 🇨🇾: 10%</strong> - I don't expect much from Pafos. Cypriot teams are not a factor on the European stage. They are a long shot.

•   <strong>Ferencváros 🇭🇺: 60%</strong> - They have a strong squad. The Hungarian league has been improving. However, they can have some slip ups.

•   <strong>Qarabağ 🇦🇿: 35%</strong> - Qarabağ is good, but the Azerbaijani league isn't a powerhouse. They can cause an upset or two, but the group stage is probably too much to ask.

•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava 🇸🇰: 20%</strong> - Slovakian football is not at the level to compete.

•   <strong>Viktoria Plzeň 🇨🇿: 50%</strong> - They can be a contender if things go their way. The Czech league has been improving lately. They will make it hard on any opponent they face.

•   <strong>Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: 80%</strong> - Scottish league has been improving lately. I expect them to easily make it in. The Champions League stage is a bare minimum for them.

•   <strong>Servette 🇨🇭: 15%</strong> - They are decent, but lack that big something. They won't win.

•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg 🇦🇹: 85%</strong> - They're a well-oiled machine with a proven track record. Expect them to make the group stage, no sweat.

•   <strong>Brann 🇳🇴: 5%</strong> - Norwegian league is simply not good enough.

•   <strong>Panathinaikos 🇬🇷: 30%</strong> - Greek teams are unpredictable. They're known for drama and inconsistency, so, I would expect a quick exit.</div>
