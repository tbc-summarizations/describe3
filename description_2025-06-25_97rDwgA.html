  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to give you the most based ranking you've ever seen. Here's the list from absolute garbage to god-tier:

1.  <strong>Pulse Demon:</strong> Absolute ear rape. Unlistenable garbage.
2.  <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin:</strong> It's a freakin' strawberry. Who cares? Overrated fruit.
3.  <strong>Face:</strong> Just a face. Boring. Needs more personality.
4.  <strong>Ice Cube Jr.:</strong> Generic object with limbs. Snooze-fest.
5.  <strong>Plunger:</strong> Utility item with a face. Still kind of boring, but at least it has a job.
6.  <strong>Goblin:</strong> Depends on the goblin, but probably annoying.
7.  <strong>Stop Breathing:</strong> I don't like being told what to do.
8.  <strong>Cold Cow:</strong> Minecraft animal. A bit bland.
9.  <strong>Cow From Minecraft:</strong> It's alright, but not great.
10. <strong>Steak:</strong> Food that is also not bad.
11. <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed?:</strong> What a horrible thought.
12. <strong>Fucking Cat:</strong> Cats are fine, nothing special.
13. <strong>Gato De Naranjas:</strong> Is not bad and not great.
14. <strong>Alex Newtron:</strong> Cool character from no one specific place.
15. <strong>Grappling Hook:</strong> Could be cool but doesn't show any use of it in this photo.
16. <strong>Evil Venus:</strong> At least it has character and personality, but it's evil so I hate it.
17. <strong>Evil Meethexep:</strong> At least it has character and personality, but it's evil so I hate it.
18. <strong>Coconut Elephant:</strong> Whack. Love the absurdity. Bonus points for unexpectedness.
19. <strong>Coke Vanilla:</strong> Surprisingly based. A good drink that not many like.
20. <strong>Kanye West:</strong> Love him or hate him, he is one of the most controversial artists of our time and has a point of view on many things.
21. <strong>Patrick Bateman Scream Cropped:</strong> Absolute madman. You can't look away.
22. <strong>AK-47:</strong> Weapon of choice for based individuals.
23.  <strong>Aldi:</strong> The best supermarket.
24. <strong>Atomic Bomb:</strong> Utter destruction, the ultimate expression of power.
25. <strong>Black Hole:</strong> Complete and utter oblivion. The ultimate end. Cannot be topped.</div>
