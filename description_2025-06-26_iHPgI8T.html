  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rating of those Spanish clubs, based on their historical significance, current performance, and overall impact:

•   <strong>Athletic Bilbao:</strong> 6/10. A historically important club with a unique Basque-only policy, which is pretty idiotic if you ask me. They have a good fanbase and can occasionally challenge for European spots, but their self-imposed player restrictions limit their potential. The uniqueness only carries them so far.

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong> 8.5/10. A major force in Spanish football, particularly under Diego Simeone. They have a strong, aggressive style of play that is fun to watch but their stadium is ugly af. They've consistently challenged Real Madrid and Barcelona and have won La Liga and Europa League titles in recent years. One of the elite teams of Spain.

•   <strong>Barcelona:</strong> 9.5/10. One of the biggest and most successful clubs in the world. With a rich history, world-class players, and a commitment to attractive attacking football. The fact that they're not a 10 is due to the financial mismanagement of the last few years. Still, a global powerhouse.

•   <strong>Celta Vigo:</strong> 4/10. A mid-table team, capable of playing exciting football at times. Celta has some talent but is mostly forgettable and not really in the top half.

•   <strong>Deportivo Alaves:</strong> 3/10. They have had a few decent seasons, but they have only avoided relegation. Not a whole lot of note, but they're kinda a little club to root for in the north.

•   <strong>Espanyol:</strong> 2/10. Barcelona's smaller, less successful neighbor. Historically a decent club, but they've been struggling lately. Their fan base isn't big and they have no global interest whatsoever. One of the worst teams in Spain.

•   <strong>Getafe:</strong> 3/10. A small club that has consistently managed to stay in La Liga. They have reached the Europa League a few times but are not an important club whatsoever. They have a loyal base in the south of Madrid.

•   <strong>Girona:</strong> 5/10. A small club from Catalonia that's actually become a strong team. Their current strong team is a fluke and if they can not get into European football in the next few years then I do not believe that they will remain relevant.

•   <strong>Las Palmas:</strong> 1/10. The team that's the least talked about in the Spanish League.

•   <strong>Leganes:</strong> 1/10. A tiny club from the suburbs of Madrid that have become an important part of the community.

•   <strong>Mallorca:</strong> 4/10. Another island club, that is very mid. Their fans are loyal and that is their biggest quality.

•   <strong>Osasuna:</strong> 5/10. A club with a passionate fan base and a strong home record. They're usually a mid-table team but they have a chance of getting into the conference league in the next few years.

•   <strong>Rayo Vallecano:</strong> 4/10. A working-class club from Madrid known for their passionate fans and leftist political views. They have been up and down between La Liga and the second division, and have become known for playing high quality soccer.

•   <strong>Real Betis:</strong> 6.5/10. A popular club with a huge and passionate fanbase. Betis play an attractive style of football, but inconsistency is an issue. They can be fun to watch, but not a major contender.

•   <strong>Real Madrid:</strong> 10/10. The most successful and arguably the biggest club in the world. They have a staggering trophy haul, a global fanbase, and consistently attract the best players. They're always in contention for every major trophy. It is impossible to argue with their historical greatness, brand and overall impact on the world.

•   <strong>Real Sociedad:</strong> 7/10. A Basque club with a rich history and a strong youth academy. They have qualified for European football consistently and play an attractive style of play, but have never became a super great team.

•   <strong>Real Valladolid:</strong> 3/10. Owned by Ronaldo, but despite his presence, the club still doesn't have much to offer. They have been a yo-yo club between La Liga and the second division. A very unexceptional team that I would barely consider worthy of being in La Liga.

•   <strong>Sevilla:</strong> 8/10. A very successful club in the Europa League, Sevilla have won the competition more than any other team. They have a strong squad and a passionate fanbase, but in recent years they have been slacking off in the league.

•   <strong>Valencia:</strong> 7/10. A historic club with a big fanbase, Valencia have fallen on hard times in recent years due to financial problems and poor management. They're still a club with potential, but need a major overhaul to return to their former glory.

•   <strong>Villarreal:</strong> 7.5/10. A small club that has punched above their weight in recent years. They've reached the Champions League semi-finals and have won the Europa League. They play an attractive style of football and have a strong squad, but their lack of resources limits their potential.</div>
