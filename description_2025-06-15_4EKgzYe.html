  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are my brutally honest star ratings for those national teams based on their historical performance:

•   <strong>Poland:</strong> ⭐⭐ - Poland has had some flashes of brilliance, like the Lato era in the 70s and more recently with Lewandowski, but overall, their history is more about near-misses and underachieving. They're not a consistent force on the world stage.

•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - The Dutch have a proud history and a recognizable style of play. They've been World Cup finalists multiple times and won a European Championship. The "Total Football" era was revolutionary, but they have been unlucky by underachieving on multiple occasions.

•   <strong>Austria:</strong> ⭐⭐ - Let's be honest, Austria's glory days are long gone. They were a force in the 1930s, but they haven't achieved much since. Their record is mediocre, and they are not a team that will ever be considered a great team.

•   <strong>France:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - France has a strong footballing history. They've won multiple World Cups and European Championships. They have some world class players too.</div>
