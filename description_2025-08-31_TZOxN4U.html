  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take on your music list:

<strong>General Impressions:</strong>

•   <strong>Overrated Classics:</strong> It's a parade of albums everyone <em>says</em> they love. It's like you compiled a "Best Albums of All Time" list from a lukewarm music blog.
•   <strong>Genre-Hopping, But Shallow:</strong> You touch on a lot of genres, but it's surface-level. You've got the "entry-level" albums for most categories. It's like someone trying to impress by listing off popular wines without knowing anything about vineyards.
•   <strong>Safe Choices:</strong> It screams "I want to be seen as having good taste without taking any risks."
•   <strong>Inconsistent Scoring:</strong> Your scoring system is arbitrary as fuck. Like The Microphones at a 70? "The Glow Pt 2" is a masterpiece.

<strong>Specific Comments:</strong>

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road (100):</strong> Fine, it's great. But "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" as the best track? It's great, but so many better tracks on this album.
•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here (100):</strong> Can't argue with a 100, but choosing the title track as the <em>worst</em>? What are you, deaf?
•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (100):</strong> Standard. "Bring da Ruckus" is a solid pick, but I prefer "Protect Ya Neck".
•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic (100):</strong> Obvious choice. "The World Is Yours" is good, but "N.Y. State of Mind" deserves to be the best track.
•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity (100):</strong> Decent album but not a 100.
•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy (100):</strong> Undeniably a masterpiece, but I don't like "Raid" as best track.
•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness (100):</strong> Overrated but ok.
•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly (95):</strong> Should be a 100. "Wesley's Theory" is a great choice for best track.
•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady (95):</strong> You almost redeemed yourself with this one...almost.
•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (95):</strong> Good but not great.
•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (95):</strong> Overrated.
•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine (95):</strong> It deserves a lower score but still ok.
•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows (95):</strong> Overrated album for overrated band.
•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King (90):</strong> Overrated but ok.
•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life (90):</strong> Overrated.
•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain (90):</strong> Pretty mid album.
•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven (80):</strong> Underrrated but it is ok since you like GYBE.
•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On (75):</strong> Severely underrated.
•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace (75):</strong> A classic and needs to be higher.
•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2 (70):</strong> Biggest crime on this list. This should be a 100. Calling the worst track "[untitled]" shows you didn't even try to understand the album.

<strong>Final Verdict:</strong>

Your taste is basic, predictable, and reveals a lack of willingness to dig deeper. You're chasing critical acclaim instead of listening to what you genuinely enjoy. Go listen to more music from underground.</div>
