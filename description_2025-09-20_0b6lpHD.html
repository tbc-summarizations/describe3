  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those tracks:

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Sleep:</strong> Overhyped, pretentious drone. It's the kind of thing hipsters listen to feel sophisticated. 4/10
•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Static:</strong> See above. Just more of the same self-indulgent garbage. 3/10
•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Storm:</strong> Still riding the same tired formula. How many minutes of drawn-out nothingness do we need? 2/10
•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Like Antennas to Heaven...:</strong> Okay, MAYBE this one has a little something going on. But the payoff takes way too long. 5/10
•   <strong>Mingus - Track D:</strong> Now we're talking! Raw, chaotic, and brilliant. This is real music. 9/10
•   <strong>John Coltrane - Part III - Pursuance / IV - Psalm:</strong> Spiritual jazz at its finest. Coltrane was a genius. 10/10
•   <strong>Joanna Newsom - Only Skin:</strong> That voice is an acquired taste, but the song is genuinely beautiful and weird. 7/10
•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Voodoo Chile:</strong> One of the greatest guitar songs ever written, hands down. 10/10
•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - 1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be):</strong> Ambitious and psychedelic. A bit too long, but still incredible. 8/10
•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5):</strong> A classic for a reason. Atmospheric, epic, and iconic. 9/10
•   <strong>Kanye West - Last Call:</strong> Funny, arrogant, and a great storytelling track. Kanye at his peak (musically). 8/10
•   <strong>Black Country, New Road - Basketball Shoes:</strong> Overrated. A mess of noise and emotion that doesn't quite gel. 5/10
•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (6-9):</strong> The second half isn't quite as good as the first, but still essential. 8/10
•   <strong>King Crimson - Moonchild:</strong> Ethereal and haunting. A perfect interlude on a classic album. 7/10
•   <strong>Joanna Newsom - Emily:</strong> Another Newsom track with a compelling melody. Not as good as Only Skin. 6/10
•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - Mortal Man:</strong> A powerful and thought-provoking song. Kendrick's lyrical ability is unmatched. 9/10
•   <strong>Miles Davis - All Blues:</strong> Relaxing and cool as hell. A jazz standard for a reason. 10/10
•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Earthmover:</strong> Depressing and emotionally draining. It's a powerful experience but I wouldn't listen to this often. 7/10
•   <strong>Daft Punk - Too Long:</strong> A masterpiece of electronic music. Repetitive in a good way. 10/10</div>
