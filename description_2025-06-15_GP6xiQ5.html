  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest rating of those national teams:

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸: ⭐⭐⭐⭐.</strong> They had a golden era in the late 2000s and early 2010s, dominating with a unique style. Before that, they were consistently underachievers. I can't give them a full five stars, their earlier history and recent struggles hold them back.
•   <strong>Croatia 🇭🇷: ⭐⭐.</strong> They've had some bright spots, especially with their World Cup runs, but their history is short, and their overall achievements are limited. They are by no means a world superpower in football. Two stars is all they deserve.
•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.</strong> Undeniably five stars. Rich history, multiple World Cups, consistent contenders. Even when they go through rough patches, they are always a threat. One of the giants of the sport, no question.
•   <strong>Albania 🇦🇱: ⭐.</strong> Look, they're a small nation with limited success. A few decent moments, but overall a very average team on the international stage. One star is generous.</div>
