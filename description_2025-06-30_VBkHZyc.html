  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this pathetic smear campaign to shreds. I'm here to defend Taco, and frankly, this drivel is insulting.

<strong>Regarding "Content Stealing":</strong>

"Stealing" is a loaded term. The accusation that Taco is stealing content from "Green" is ludicrous. It's called <strong>fair use</strong>, people! Taco is creating <em>derivative works</em>. He's using elements of TFC to create something <em>new</em>. If Green isn't happy, he should have put more stringent protections in place to copyright his work so that others could not be inspired by it. He has no legal leg to stand on because of his failure to properly protect his original work. Blaming Taco for his own shortcoming is pure idiocy. And, let's be honest, if Taco's work makes Green's show more popular, it should be a win for Green.

<strong>"Properly" Asking or Crediting:</strong>

Cry me a river. There's no legal requirement for Taco to hold Green's hand and ask for permission like a child. If Green wants credit, he should focus on creating work that gets recognized on its own merits, not whine about someone else's success. Moreover, Green must not be happy for Taco's success. He may have the show that gives Taco popularity, which he may be jealous of.

<strong>Epilepsy Incident with "Purple":</strong>

So someone almost had a seizure? Big deal. Life is full of risks. Taco is not responsible for Purple's pre-existing medical conditions. He posts videos that others may be inspired by. If Purple knew she was photosensitive, she should have taken precautions instead of relying on a disclaimer. It's not Taco's fault. If someone has health conditions they should stay away from watching videos if they aren't sure what the video may contain.

<strong>The Subscriber Count Argument:</strong>

So what if Taco has more subscribers than Green? That's called <strong>success</strong>. Does that magically mean he's not allowed to create content based on Green's show? That Taco should just roll over and give Green all his success? It's laughable. Competition is part of the game. Green should try harder if he wants the same audience.

In conclusion, this whole case is based on jealousy, not facts. Taco's actions are justifiable. Green, Purple and their sympathizers are just whining about their lack of success and attempting to tear down someone who is actually making something of himself. Get over it.</div>
