  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get straight to it. Here's my brutally honest assessment of each club's chances of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stage from the play-off round:

•   <strong>Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: 65%</strong> Celtic usually gets a big benefit playing in their home stadium with their fans in their back. This is a big advantage in the play-off round. However, their defense is often questionable, and they tend to crumble under pressure against tactically astute teams.

•   <strong>Basel 🇨🇭: 30%</strong> Basel have a respectable history in European competitions, but their current form is not impressive. The Swiss league is far weaker than the top leagues, and Basel's squad simply lacks the quality and experience to consistently compete at the Champions League level. They're likely to get outmuscled and outplayed by tougher opposition.

•   <strong>Sturm Graz 🇦🇹: 20%</strong> Sturm Graz has been improving, but they are not consistent enough to make it to the UEFA Champions League group stages. The Austrian league is also not very good as a whole, so they might lack experience to play at this high level.

•   *<em><strong>Bodø/Glimt 🇳🇴</strong>: 45%</em>* They can be a tricky team to play against, especially at home. But it is unlikely they will make it due to the fact that other teams are better and more consistent.</div>
