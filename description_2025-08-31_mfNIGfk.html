  <div class="discord-text">Alright, check it, this is how I see those Mobb Deep albums, straight up:

•   <strong>Juvenile Hell:</strong> 3/10. Listen, early days, raw potential, but honestly sounds like they were still figuring things out. Not my style, needs more polish.
•   <strong>The Infamous:</strong> 10/10. A classic, straight fire. Dark, gritty, perfect production. This is what hip-hop is all about.
•   <strong>Hell on Earth:</strong> 8/10. Keeps the energy from "The Infamous", but maybe a bit too much of the same. Still a banger.
•   <strong>Murda Muzik:</strong> 6/10. Some bangers on here for sure, but felt like they were chasing the commercial sound a little too much.
•   <strong>Infamy:</strong> 5/10. Trying to evolve but it didn't really work. Production felt dated.
•   <strong>Amerikaz Nightmare:</strong> 4/10. A mess, honestly. Too many producers, no clear direction. They were trying to do too much and lost the essence of what made them great.
•   <strong>Blood Money:</strong> 2/10. Trying to sound relevant, but just sounded generic. Not feeling it at all.
•   <strong>The Infamous... Mobb Deep:</strong> 5/10. A decent attempt to recapture the old magic, but it just wasn't the same. Like a reunion tour, good but not great.</div>
