  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this flimsy case against Taco, shall we? The prosecution presents a pathetic narrative of manipulation and ill-intent. I'm here to obliterate it.

<strong>The "Gentle Candy" Debacle:</strong>

First, Orange's request for Taco to give Pink a "lollipop or simple candy" is the basis of the charge of not being gentle, let's be honest. Is Taco now obligated to fulfill the whims of every single one of Pink's friends? "Alright" does not equate to a binding contract, and even if it did, where are the damages? Pink didn't wither away from a lack of confectionery generosity, did she? This is utterly ridiculous and reeks of clutching at straws.

<strong>The "Manipulation" Myth:</strong>

The charge that Taco is a serial manipulator is unsubstantiated garbage. Where's the evidence of coercion, undue influence, or any actual harm inflicted on these alleged victims? Presenting a generalized claim of manipulation without specific instances or tangible consequences is nothing more than a smear campaign. Pink chose to sever her friendship with Taco, and that was her right. Taco's actions afterward, however misguided, do not inherently constitute manipulation.

<strong>The "Stalker" Accusation:</strong>

Taco sitting in front of Pink's class talking to someone? Is he not allowed to exist in public spaces? Kanade's panicked reaction to seeing Taco watching her is her own issue. We can't crucify someone for merely being present and observing. And then Taco messages her happy birthday to Pinkâ€™s mom. Is this not considered as a nice gesture to do?

<strong>The "Banned from Server" Outrage:</strong>

Finally, the grand injustice of Pink being banned from Taco's new server! Are you serious? Taco is the administrator of <em>his own</em> server, and he's entitled to curate the community as he sees fit. This is not a human right. This isn't oppression. It's a server invite. Get over it!

In conclusion, this case is built on speculation, assumptions, and an overblown sense of entitlement. Taco's actions may be interpreted as awkward or even insensitive, but they fall far short of manipulation, harassment, or any legitimate wrongdoing. This is a petty feud blown out of proportion, and I move for its immediate dismissal.</div>
