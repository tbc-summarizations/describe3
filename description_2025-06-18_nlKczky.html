  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the clubs potentially participating in the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League:

<strong>Expected Giants, No Surprise Here:</strong>

•   <strong>Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester City, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> These clubs are perennial contenders. Their presence is expected, and frankly, it would be shocking if they <em>weren't</em> in the Champions League. They have the resources, infrastructure, and history to consistently compete at the highest level.

<strong>Glad to See Them, Deservedly There:</strong>

•   <strong>Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Napoli, Bayer Leverkusen:</strong> Strong clubs with a rich history and tradition. Seeing them in the Champions League feels right. They bring quality and prestige to the tournament.

<strong>The Surprise Packages, Eye-Openers:</strong>

•   <strong>Athletic Bilbao:</strong> This is genuinely surprising. While they have history, their recent form hasn't screamed "Champions League contender." It would be interesting to see how they adapt to the competition if they manage to qualify. I would enjoy watching them in champions league.
•   <strong>Galatasaray:</strong> Turkish football can be unpredictable. Galatasaray's inclusion could be a wildcard, depending on their form at the time.

<strong>The "Hope They Don't Embarrass Themselves" Category:</strong>

•   <strong>Slavia Prague, Olympiacos, Union Saint-Gilloise, Sporting CP</strong> I'm not saying these teams do not deserve to be there, but their presence is usually an indicator the a bigger club failed or just wasn't as good. As such, I don't expect a lot of glory for those names, though I would love to be proven wrong.

<strong>Potential Underachievers?</strong>

•   <strong>Chelsea:</strong> Frankly, they've been all over the place. I would not be surprised if their inclusion becomes a detriment, although it is possible they could do well.

This is just one possible list. I am interested in seeing how these clubs manage to reach the 2025-26 season.</div>
