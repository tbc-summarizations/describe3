  <div class="discord-text">Aight, listen up, cuz I gotta be real wit' ya. This Mos Def dude? Overrated, straight up. Here's how I see his albums:

•   <strong>Black on Both Sides</strong>: 4/10. It's got some hype, but it's all talk, no bite. Like, where's the energy? Where's the bars that hit hard? Just a bunch of sleepy rhymes.

•   <strong>The New Danger</strong>: 2/10. What is this garbage? He's tryna be all artsy and it's just annoying. Sounds like he's just throwing sounds at the wall and hoping something sticks. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.

•   <strong>True Magic</strong>: 0/10. I ain't even listening to this trash. The cover tells me everything. Looks like he gave up even tryna make an album.

•   <strong>The Ecstatic</strong>: 3/10. Okay, so it's slightly better than the others, but that's not saying much. It's still boring and full of pretension. Wake me up when he starts rapping about something real.

•   <strong>Negus</strong>: 1/10. More like <em>Negativity</em>. No real songs? No thank you. You can't just put out snippets of something and call it a album and expect people to like it.

Overall, this dude is straight basura. He needs to start making music that actually slaps. And while we are at it, stop trying to act so holier than thou. All of this is just my opinion though.</div>
