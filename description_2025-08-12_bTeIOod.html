  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this "No Ballon d'Or" XI with the cold, hard truth:

<strong>Individual Ratings (Out of 10)</strong>

•   <strong>Manuel Neuer (9.5/10):</strong> Prime Neuer revolutionized goalkeeping. His sweeping, distribution, and shot-stopping were unmatched. The best goalkeeper of all time.
•   <strong>Paolo Maldini (10/10):</strong> The embodiment of defensive elegance and longevity. Flawless positioning, impeccable tackling, and an unparalleled reading of the game. The Greatest Defender Of All Time and it's not even close.
•   <strong>Virgil van Dijk (9/10):</strong> At his peak, a colossus. Dominant in the air, quick, and an exceptional passer. He briefly reached Maldini-esque levels, but lacked the sustained excellence.
•   <strong>Sergio Ramos (8.5/10):</strong> A ruthless competitor, brilliant in both boxes, and a master of the dark arts. His disciplinary record is a big black mark, preventing a higher rating.
•   <strong>Neymar (8/10):</strong> Dazzling dribbler and creator. He was always slightly overrated due to the hype surrounding him.
•   <strong>Xavi (9.5/10):</strong> The metronome. Dictated tempo, rarely misplaced a pass, and defined an era of possession-based football. But, was never really a great solo performer.
•   <strong>Toni Kroos (9/10):</strong> The understated genius. Composed, precise, and an expert at controlling the midfield. His passing range was absurd, but he rarely made flashy plays.
•   <strong>Andres Iniesta (9.5/10):</strong> The magician. Unpredictable dribbling, incredible vision, and the ability to unlock any defense. His decline was faster than Xavi's, however.
•   <strong>Luis Suarez (9/10):</strong> The ultimate striker. Relentless pressing, clinical finishing, and a knack for the spectacular. Could be a menace off the ball. The best striker of the 2010s.
•   <strong>Robert Lewandowski (9.5/10):</strong> The goal machine. Perfect technique, exceptional movement, and lethal in the box. Should've won at least 2 Ballon d'Ors.
•   <strong>Thierry Henry (9/10):</strong> Electric pace, silky dribbling, and a deadly finisher. A modern great, but prone to inconsistency in big games.

<strong>Team Rating (Out of 10): 9.6/10</strong>

This team is monstrously good, with the right balance of defensive solidity, midfield control, and attacking firepower. The only minor question mark is Neymar's tactical discipline and if he'd mesh well with the other midfielders.

<strong>Chances of Winning the World Cup:</strong> 75%

In a World Cup scenario, this team would be terrifying. The midfield dominance of Xavi, Iniesta, and Kroos would suffocate opponents. The forwards would feast on the chances created. Defensively, they would be virtually impenetrable. The main threat would be complacency or an off day from Neuer.

<strong>Chances of Winning the Champions League:</strong> 90%

In a Champions League format, this team would be even more dominant. Their ability to control games, suffocate opponents, and exploit any weakness makes them nearly unstoppable. The only thing that would stop them is a freak occurrence or a tactical masterclass from a top manager.

<strong>Brutal Honesty</strong>

This team is ridiculously overpowered. It's a crime that none of these players won a Ballon d'Or in their prime (except for Messi and Ronaldo). They would likely dominate any era of football. Their only weakness is the potential for egos to clash, but if managed well, they would be unstoppable. This team is not just good; it's legendary.</div>
