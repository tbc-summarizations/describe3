  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this collection of tracks.

•   <strong>Pharoah Sanders - The Creator Has a Master Plan (85):</strong> A nearly 33-minute spiritual jazz epic, and it only scores an 85? Apparently, God's plan didn't include a better rating here.

•   <strong>Swans - The Glowing Man (60):</strong> Swans at a 60? Someone clearly prefers their music to be easily digestible and radio-friendly. Good luck with that in the Swans discography.

•   <strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Sleep (75):</strong> "Sleep" is appropriately named because listening to the whole thing might just put you into a coma. 75/100 seems generous.

•   <strong>Frankie M (30):</strong> Oof, a 30. That's not just bad; it's offensively bad. What unholy bargain did this track strike to even be included?

•   <strong>Mingus - Track D (95):</strong> Finally, something with taste. But let's be honest, you only included it to look cultured.

•   <strong>Joanna Newsom - Only Skin (90):</strong> I bet you only like this because you want to show off your sophisticated taste.

•   <strong>Car Seat Headrest - Famous Prophets (Stars) (85):</strong> It's trying so hard to be profound, but it ends up just being kinda... long.

•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Voodoo Chile (60):</strong> Hendrix at a 60? That's musical blasphemy.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5) (100):</strong> Guaranteed this person only knows this song because it's on every "Greatest Songs of All Time" list.

•   <strong>Kanye West - Last Call (100):</strong> The College Dropout is a classic album, but a 100? Come on!

•   <strong>Black Country, New Road - Basketball Shoes (100):</strong> You're just trying to seem hip and current. 100 is too much

•   <strong>King Crimson - Moonchild (60):</strong> This is the person who likes "the idea" of prog more than actually listening to it.

•   <strong>Miles Davis - All Blues (100):</strong> I bet you put it on just to look cool

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Earthmover (100):</strong> Good song, but calm down it's not actually that good.

•   <strong>Bob Dylan - Desolation Row (60):</strong> You actually listen to Bob Dylan?

•   <strong>Daft Punk - Too Long (100):</strong> This track is called "Too Long" and it's scored a 100? Oh the Irony

In conclusion, this playlist is a scattered mess, jumping between genres and quality levels like a caffeinated kangaroo. It's trying to be deep, hip, and cultured all at once, but mostly it just comes across as pretentious.</div>
