  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this underwhelming tournament group stage with the brutal honesty it deserves.

<strong>Teams That Overperformed:</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> They absolutely smashed Group A. 9 points out of 9? Nobody saw that coming. They weren't just winning; they were suffocating their opponents defensively. To concede only one goal and topping group is an absolute triumph.
•   <strong>Armenia:</strong> Similar to Kazakhstan, their dominance in Group C was unexpected. Clean sheet in all three games, securing 9 points in the group.
•   <strong>Faroe Islands and Kosovo:</strong> Group B was a two-horse race, and these teams delivered. Faroe Islands with their relentless attacking football, and Kosovo with their efficiency in front of goal, it was a treat to watch.

<strong>Teams That Massively Underperformed:</strong>

•   <strong>Gibraltar:</strong> Their performance was atrocious. One measly goal scored, and a leaky defense. No fight, no strategy, just pure disappointment.
•   <strong>Moldova:</strong> Zero goals. Zero points. A complete offensive collapse. It's like they didn't even bother showing up. I guess the only good thing about this tournament for them is that it is over.
•   <strong>Azerbaijan:</strong> Their performance was an absolute embarrassment. They were just pathetic.

<strong>Surprises:</strong>

•   <strong>Liechtenstein:</strong> Their 3-1 victory over Gibraltar was the biggest shock of the group stage. It was like watching a toddler beat a grown man.
•   <strong>Belarus:</strong> No goals, not even one win? Come on, they are the hosts. This is pathetic, and their coach should be fired immediately.

<strong>Disappointments:</strong>

•   <strong>San Marino:</strong> As always, the laughing stock of the tournament. They showed no ambition and looked completely disinterested.
•   <strong>Lithuania:</strong> Considering they were in a relatively weak group, only managing to get 5 points is unacceptable. Their draw against Estonia was a major setback.

<strong>Surprising Matches:</strong>

•   <strong>Liechtenstein 3 - 1 Gibraltar:</strong> Absolutely no one expected Liechtenstein to dominate this match. Gibraltar were supposed to be the slightly better team, but they got completely outplayed.
•   <strong>Belarus 0 - 1 Estonia:</strong> Belarus's loss to Estonia was an unexpected blow. This match showed that their team lacks any real direction or leadership.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

This group stage was filled with mediocre football and shocking upsets. Some teams exceeded expectations, while others completely crumbled under pressure. Let's hope the round of 16 brings more excitement and less disappointment.</div>
