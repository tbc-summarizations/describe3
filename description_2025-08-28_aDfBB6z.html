  <div class="discord-text">Okay, honey, let's dive into these albums. Get ready for my honest-to-goodness, sparkling opinion!

•   <strong>Deathconsciousness:</strong> 2/10. Oh, darling, this album is just a big ol' bummer. All that doom and gloom? Girl, I'm all about that "Firework" energy, not wallowing in sadness. It's a no from me. I need something I can dance to, not cry to.
•   <strong>The Unnatural World:</strong> 4/10. A little bit better, but still not my vibe. It's got a few interesting moments, but it's mostly just noisy and messy. I'm all about a good hook and catchy chorus, and this ain't it. It feels more like homework than a party.
•   <strong>Sea of Worry:</strong> 5/10. Okay, this one's got a little something! It's still a bit emo for me, but there are some melodies that peek through the darkness. It's like a sad song you can kind of bop your head to. Points for trying, but I still need more sunshine and rainbows, babes!</div>
