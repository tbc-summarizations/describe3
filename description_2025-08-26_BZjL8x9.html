  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cut the crap and get to it. Here's my brutally honest, rock-biased assessment of these albums:

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> (5/10) I'm a rock fan, so sue me if I'm not head-over-heels for experimental electronic music. It's alright, has some cool moments, but it's just too out there for my taste.

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> (10/10) Absolutely essential rock. Bowie was a genius, and this is his masterpiece. Glam rock at its finest, with killer riffs, a captivating story, and an undeniable energy. If you don't like this, you don't like rock music.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> (6/10) This album could be good but it's too long.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> (5/10) I'm too happy for this album. I'm a rock fan, so sue me if I'm not head-over-heels for experimental electronic music. It's alright, has some cool moments, but it's just too out there for my taste.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> (8/10) Buckley had an insane voice, and this album showcases it beautifully. The songwriting is strong, and the emotional depth is palpable. It's a tragedy he didn't make more.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> (7/10) This is a good album, i just think it's overrated.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> (9/10) Proto-prog masterpiece. This album is essential.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> (7/10) A great album, but I like it because of other genres as a rock fan.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> (6/10) A great album, but I like it because of other genres as a rock fan.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> (6/10) A great album, but I like it because of other genres as a rock fan.

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> (5/10) This album just isn't for me.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> (6/10) A great album, but I like it because of other genres as a rock fan.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> (9/10) Classic Floyd. Atmospheric, melancholic, and full of soaring guitar solos. It's a bit overplayed, but there's no denying its impact on rock music.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> (9/10) A masterpiece, I do not care for it's popularity, it still goes hard.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> (8/10) A good album but their others are better.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> (6/10) A great album, but I like it because of other genres as a rock fan.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> (8/10) This is a good album.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> (10/10) If you don't like The Beatles, you don't like rock music.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> (5/10) This album just isn't for me.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> (6/10) A great album, but I like it because of other genres as a rock fan.</div>
