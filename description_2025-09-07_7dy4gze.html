  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Azerbaijan squad with the brutal honesty you asked for. No sugarcoating here.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Rza Cafarov (Neftchi ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Playing in the domestic league isn't much of a testament. Likely a backup at best, and not a very inspiring one.
â€¢   <strong>Shahrudin Mahammadaliyev (QarabaÄŸ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 5/10. Probably the best of a bad bunch. QarabaÄŸ is the strongest team in Azerbaijan, but that doesn't translate to world-class quality.
â€¢   <strong>Aydyn Bayramov (Zira ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 2/10. Another domestic player who probably isn't good enough to be a starter on a serious national team.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Bahlul Mustafazada (QarabaÄŸ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. Decent enough for the Azerbaijan league, but likely to struggle against stronger international opponents.
â€¢   <strong>Calal HÃ¼seynov (Arda Kardzhali ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬):</strong> 3/10. Playing in Bulgaria's league isn't a good sign. Probably slow and error-prone.
â€¢   <strong>Anton Kryvotsiuk (Daejeon Hana Citizen ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·):</strong> 4/10. Playing in South Korea doesn't scream defensive solidity. Could be a liability.
â€¢   <strong>Elvin Badalov (Neftchi ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 2/10. Another domestic player who is likely a squad filler at best.
â€¢   <strong>Toral Bayramov (QarabaÄŸ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. Probably similar to Mustafazada, decent domestically but lacks international quality.
â€¢   <strong>Elvin Cafarquliyev (QarabaÄŸ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. Again, QarabaÄŸ is the best in Azerbaijan, but it's not a high bar.
â€¢   <strong>Rahman Dashdamirov (Sabah ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Nothing stands out. Probably error-prone and struggles with pace.
â€¢   <strong>Qismat Aliyev (Zira ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 2/10. Sounds like a squad player, nothing more.
â€¢   <strong>Abbas HÃ¼seynov (QarabaÄŸ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. See Cafarquliyev and Bayramov.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Ismayil Ibrahimli (Zira ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Unlikely to offer much creativity or defensive steel.
â€¢   <strong>Sabuhi Abdullazada (Sumgayit ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 2/10. Doesn't inspire confidence. Probably lacks the quality to compete at the international level.
â€¢   <strong>Emin Mahmudov (Neftchi ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 5/10. Probably the best of the midfield options, but that's not saying much.
â€¢   <strong>Ceyhun Nuriyev (Zira ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Might be hardworking, but lacks the technical skills to make a real impact.
â€¢   <strong>Anatoliy Nuriyev (Sabah ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Similar to Ceyhun, likely to be a limited player.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Khayal Aliyev (Sabah ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Probably lacks the pace and skill to trouble international defenders.
â€¢   <strong>Ozan KÃ¶kcÃ¼ (Volendam ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±):</strong> 4/10. Playing in the Netherlands, but for Volendam is not a good sign. Probably a limited player who will struggle against stronger opposition.
â€¢   <strong>Nariman Akhundzada (QarabaÄŸ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. More of the same from QarabaÄŸ â€“ not terrible, but not good enough.
â€¢   <strong>Mahir Emreli (Kaiserslautern ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 5/10. Playing in the German second division, could be useful, but probably inconsistent.
â€¢   <strong>Renat Dadashov (Motor Lublin ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±):</strong> 4/10. Polish league isn't the best, but the best of the bunch, but isn't a great indicator of quality.
â€¢   <strong>Musa Qurbanly (QarabaÄŸ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. Young player, decent but definitely unproven in a tougher league.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

<strong>3/10.</strong>

This squad is painfully average. There's a serious lack of quality throughout the team. Most of the players are either from the domestic league or playing in relatively weak foreign leagues. They would struggle against any decent European team. Expect a lot of defensive football, hoping for a lucky draw or a scrappy win. They would most likely be thrashed by any of the top teams in the world.</div>
