  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this disastrous group.

<strong>France and Italy</strong>: No surprises here. Expected them to be top contenders and they delivered, scraping by with the same points. I am impressed by France winning in Italy on matchday 6, that probably means that they can be considered a favorite to win the whole competition.

<strong>Belgium</strong>: What a colossal disappointment. This team was hyped for years, and they're barely clinging to League A. One win? Against Israel? Their golden generation is clearly tarnished, and it's time for a complete overhaul. Prepare for those relegation play-offs, because you don't deserve to be here.

<strong>Israel</strong>: I hate this team. Relegation was inevitable. Their only win coming against Belgium, what a joke. They're clearly outclassed, and League B is where they belong. Time to rebuild from the ground up.</div>
