  <h1>Description for final_imguami_commentary.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Here's a brutally honest translation of what he's saying:

<strong>Red Bull Image:</strong>

"This is my favorite, f<em>ck! It keeps grinding all day, drilling into my brain. If you take one sip, you'll say, "Damn, the world is beautiful!" F</em>ck!"

<strong>Doritos Image:</strong>

"When these Doritos are lying around, I worry about how they'll scratch the screen, f<em>ck! They get in everything, fall between the keyboard keys, and then cleaning them is just damn hard, f</em>ck!"

<strong>Keyboard Image:</strong>

"How much sweat have I left on the buttons of this keyboard, f<em>ck! Every game, every job. It's like my whole life is passing by right here."

<strong>Fuse Tea Image:</strong>

"This peach tea - after drinking that red bottle, when my brain starts spinning, it's something that calms me down a bit, f</em>ck. It really says "f*ck off" to my nerves."</div>
