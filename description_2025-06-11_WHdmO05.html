  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic excuse for a qualifying group:

•   <strong>Finland:</strong> Leading the pack? Really? With a zero goal difference and having played half their games? They're practically begging to choke. Enjoy the temporary high, Finns, because reality is about to hit you harder than a Baltic winter.

•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> Two games played and ten goals scored? Impressive, I'll give them that. But let's see if they can keep this up against tougher competition. For now, they're the only team in this group that seems to understand the basic concept of scoring goals.

•   <strong>Poland:</strong> Another overrated team coasting on a few lucky wins. Four goals in three games? That's hardly world-class. They'll probably squeak into the play-offs and then embarrass themselves on the international stage.

•   <strong>Lithuania:</strong> Two draws and one loss? Congratulations, you've managed to be slightly less awful than Malta. But let's be honest, you're just taking up space. Don't expect to see them anywhere near qualification. They should just pack it up now.

•   <strong>Malta:</strong> Oh, Malta. Zero goals scored and eleven conceded? That's not just bad, that's historically awful. You're a disgrace to the sport. Do everyone a favor and forfeit the rest of your games. Seriously, what's the point of them even competing?</div>
