  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of Germany's 2014 World Cup winning starting XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Manuel Neuer:</strong> 9.5/10 - At his peak, Neuer revolutionized goalkeeping. His shot-stopping was world-class, but his ability to play as a sweeper-keeper truly set him apart. Arguably the best goalkeeper of his generation.
•   <strong>Philipp Lahm:</strong> 9/10 - An absolute machine at right-back. Lahm was tactically intelligent, technically gifted, and a natural leader. Rarely put a foot wrong and could play almost anywhere on the pitch.
•   <strong>Jérôme Boateng:</strong> 7.5/10 - Solid and athletic center-back. Boateng was strong in the tackle and good in the air, but prone to occasional lapses in concentration. Not as consistent as some of his peers.
•   <strong>Mats Hummels:</strong> 8/10 - Elegant and intelligent defender. Hummels excelled at reading the game and playing the ball out from the back. Could be vulnerable against pacey attackers but his strengths outweighed his weaknesses.
•   <strong>Benedikt Höwedes:</strong> 6.5/10 - A reliable but unspectacular left-back. Höwedes was a hard worker and defensively solid, but lacked the flair and attacking prowess of other full-backs in the team.
•   <strong>Christoph Kramer:</strong> 6/10 - Decent but forgettable. Kramer had the unenviable task of replacing Sami Khedira but was injured early in the final. He wasn't terrible but was still a weak spot compared to other midfielders in the squad.
•   <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger:</strong> 8.5/10 - The heart and soul of the team. Schweinsteiger was a warrior in midfield, combining tenacity with excellent passing range. His performance in the final was legendary, battling through injury to dominate the game.
•   <strong>Toni Kroos:</strong> 9/10 - A metronomic passer with exceptional vision. Kroos dictated the tempo of games with his precise distribution and tactical awareness. One of the best midfielders in the world at the time.
•   <strong>Thomas Müller:</strong> 8/10 - An unconventional but highly effective forward. Müller's movement was unpredictable, and his finishing was clinical. A master of exploiting space and finding the back of the net.
•   <strong>Miroslav Klose:</strong> 7/10 - A veteran striker who provided valuable experience and leadership. Klose wasn't at his peak physically, but his goal-scoring instincts were still sharp.
•   <strong>Mesut Özil:</strong> 7/10 - A talented playmaker with moments of brilliance. Özil possessed exceptional vision and passing ability but could drift in and out of games. Not always consistent enough for a player of his caliber.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>8.8/10</strong> - This Germany team was well-balanced, tactically flexible, and mentally strong. They had world-class players in key positions and a clear sense of identity. While they weren't the most dominant team in World Cup history, they were deserved champions. This team had flaws, such as Kramer being weak, or Boateng not being that reliable, but all of the weaknesses were covered well, either because they were not exploited by other teams, or the rest of the squad picked up the slack.

Is that brutal enough for you?</div>
