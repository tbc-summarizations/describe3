  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because you're about to witness a Chelsea fanatic unleashed! Let's tear into this Europa League campaign!

<strong>League Phase:</strong>

•   <strong>Matchday 1: Chelsea 0-0 Tobol:</strong> A goalless draw against Tobol? Pathetic! What were the Blues doing? Sleeping on the pitch? Tobol, a team from Kazakhstan, shouldn't even be on the same field as Chelsea. Embarrassing start!
•   <strong>Matchday 2: VfB Stuttgart 0-1 Chelsea:</strong> Finally, a win! But Stuttgart, seriously? We should be smashing these German has-beens. A 1-0 win is barely a victory for the mighty Chelsea.
•   <strong>Matchday 3: Chelsea 4-1 Slovan Bratislava:</strong> Now that's more like it! Four goals! Slovan Bratislava, you just got schooled by the best team in London. Serves you right for even showing up.
•   <strong>Matchday 4: Vitoria Guimaraes 0-1 Chelsea:</strong> Another narrow win? Guimaraes should be honored they only lost by one goal. Chelsea was probably just toying with them.
•   <strong>Matchday 5: Chelsea 3-0 Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> Shakhtar, you came to Stamford Bridge and got hammered. Three goals, no reply. Maybe stick to Ukrainian league where you actually belong.
•   <strong>Matchday 6: Galatasaray 0-3 Chelsea:</strong> Three goals in Turkey? Galatasaray got absolutely demolished in their own backyard! Their fans must be crying in their kebabs. Chelsea is just too good.
•   <strong>Matchday 7: Chelsea 2-1 Real Sociedad:</strong> Real Sociedad thought they could challenge the Blues? Two goals in response to their one? Back to Spain with your tails between your legs, you tiny club.
•   <strong>Matchday 8: Athletic Bilbao 0-1 Chelsea:</strong> Another tough win. I expected way more!

<strong>Round of 16:</strong>

•   <strong>1st Leg: Newcastle United 2-0 Chelsea:</strong> What in the world was that performance? Losing to Newcastle? Absolutely unacceptable! Two goals? Chelsea were sleepwalking.
•   <strong>2nd Leg: Chelsea 4-1 Newcastle United:</strong> That's how you respond! Four goals to shut up those Geordie fools! St. James' Park is shaking right now from the loss! Chelsea show them what a real team looks like.

<strong>Quarter-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>1st Leg: Chelsea 2-1 SC Freiburg:</strong> A close win against Freiburg? They got too cocky, and they barely won a game that should have been a massacre, and you know what? They paid the price for the first leg result and that is enough for me.
•   <strong>2nd Leg: SC Freiburg 0-1 Chelsea:</strong> Again? Barely winning against this team? I should feel ashamed that the score isn't more favourable for us.

<strong>Semi-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>1st Leg: Chelsea 4-0 Athletic Bilbao:</strong> Four goals! Athletic Bilbao got completely embarrassed at Stamford Bridge. They should be thanking their lucky stars it wasn't more.
•   <strong>2nd Leg: Athletic Bilbao 0-0 Chelsea:</strong> A draw in Bilbao? I'm proud for the boys for managing to keep a clean sheet against this team.

<strong>Final:</strong>

•   <strong>Chelsea 5-0 Tobol:</strong> FIVE GOALS! Tobol got absolutely humiliated! They shouldn't even be allowed to call themselves a football team. Chelsea showed them what world-class football looks like. The Kazakh team should go back to riding horses on the steppes.

<strong>Pedro Neto:</strong> Top goalscorer? Of course! Pedro Neto is a Chelsea legend in the making. Eleven goals? That's what a true striker does. Bow down to the king!

Chelsea reigns supreme! Every team that faced us got a taste of what real football is! Bring on the next challenge, because Chelsea is always ready to dominate!</div>
