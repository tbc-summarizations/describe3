  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest, detailed commentary on that absolutely pathetic Portugal vs. France penalty shootout debacle:

<strong>Portugal choked. Plain and simple.</strong>

•   <strong>Ronaldo's early goal?</strong> A flicker of false hope. He's a glorified penalty merchant at this point, relying on set pieces to mask his fading relevance.

•   <strong>Bruno Fernandes, you useless donkey.</strong> Missing a crucial penalty in a final? That's unforgivable. Should be banned from taking penalties ever again.

•   <strong>The rest of the Portuguese squad?</strong> Mediocre. Just names on a team sheet. Silva's man-of-the-match rating means nothing when they lost. Individual brilliance doesn't win titles, mental fortitude does. They are just mid.

<strong>France, on the other hand, were cold and calculating.</strong>

•   <strong>Mbappé's penalty?</strong> Clinical. He has the killer instinct Portugal lacks. Should learn from him.

•   <strong>Thuram, Dembele, Kante, Rabiot</strong> - The rest just got their job done which is good enough.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

This final was a testament to Portugal's inability to handle pressure. They crumble when it matters. France, while not spectacular, capitalized on Portugal's weakness. They have got the win fair enough.</div>
