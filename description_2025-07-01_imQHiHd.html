  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this team. I'm not holding back.

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Manuel Neuer (GK):</strong> At his peak, a revolutionary goalkeeper. Sweeper-keeper abilities combined with insane reflexes. Distribution was top-tier. <em>Rating: 9.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Andrew Robertson (LB):</strong> Relentless energy, great crosser, solid defensively. Top-class modern fullback. <em>Rating: 8.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Virgil van Dijk (CB):</strong> Dominant, athletic, amazing passer. Absolute rock at his best. <em>Rating: 9.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Ruben Dias (CB):</strong> Leadership, aggression, brilliant in the air and on the ground. <em>Rating: 8.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold (RB):</strong> Unbelievable passer and crosser, vision like a midfielder, defensively a liability. <em>Rating: 8/10</em>

•   <strong>Kevin De Bruyne (CM):</strong> Passing range unmatched, creative genius, goal-scoring threat. <em>Rating: 9.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Rodri (CDM):</strong> Holds it down, great passer, tactically intelligent, defensively sound. <em>Rating: 8.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Kylian Mbappe (FW):</strong> Blazing speed, lethal finisher, dribbling god. <em>Rating: 9.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo (FW):</strong> Goal machine, incredible in the air, clutch performer. <em>Rating: 9.5/10</em>

•   <strong>Lionel Messi (FW):</strong> Dribbling wizard, genius passer, goal scorer. <em>Rating: 10/10</em>

•   <strong>Neymar Jr. (FW):</strong> Amazing dribbler, unpredictable, creative genius. <em>Rating: 9/10</em>

<strong>Team Rating and Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Overall Rating: 8.9/10</strong>

•   <strong>Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Attack:</strong> The attack is obviously incredible. Messi, Ronaldo, Mbappe, Neymar all at their best is almost unfair. You're guaranteed goals, creativity, and nightmares for any defense.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> De Bruyne and Rodri is a great combination. De Bruyne's creativity combined with Rodri's defensive solidity would be an excellent combination.
•   <strong>Defense:</strong> This is where the team is somewhat vulnerable. Van Dijk and Dias are amazing but Alexander-Arnold's defensive frailties would be a problem. Robertson would be a solid choice on the left side.
•   <strong>Tactical Issues:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Exposure:</strong> 4-2-4 is super attacking, and the fullbacks are attack-minded. Rodri needs to cover a <em>lot</em> of ground. This team could be ripped apart by a counter-attacking team with pace.
•   <strong>Ego Clashes:</strong> Can Ronaldo and Messi really co-exist <em>perfectly</em>? Neymar also wants to be the star. This team needs a strong manager to keep the egos in check.
•   <strong>Work Rate:</strong> The attackers, while brilliant, aren't known for their defensive work rate. This puts even more pressure on the midfield and defense.</div>
