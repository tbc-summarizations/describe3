  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Bosnia squad with brutal honesty:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Nikola Vasilj:</strong> A solid, if unspectacular, keeper. Does his job, but doesn't steal games. 6/10
•   <strong>Kenan Piric:</strong> Backup material, nothing more. 4/10
•   <strong>Martin Zlomislic:</strong> Unknown quantity, likely not ready for primetime. 3/10

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Sead Kolasinac:</strong> Past his prime, prone to errors, and lacks the pace he once had. 5/10
•   <strong>Ermin Bicakcic:</strong> Injury-prone and unreliable. 4/10
•   <strong>Dennis Hadzikadunic:</strong> Decent potential, but inconsistent performances. 6/10
•   <strong>Anel Ahmedhodzic:</strong> Arguably the best defender, but can be rash. 7/10
•   <strong>Jusuf Gazibegovic:</strong> Average full-back, offers little going forward. 5/10
•   <strong>Amar Dedic:</strong> Promising young talent, but needs more experience. 6/10
•   <strong>Adrian Leon Barisic:</strong> Another unknown, potential to be a decent option but very unlikely. 4/10

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Rade Krunic:</strong> A workhorse, but lacks creativity and flair. 6/10
•   <strong>Benjamin Tahirovic:</strong> Promising youngster, could be a key player in the future. 7/10
•   <strong>Haris Hajradinovic:</strong> Average midfielder, doesn't stand out in any area. 5/10
•   <strong>Armin Gigovic:</strong> Decent depth, but not a game-changer. 5/10
•   <strong>Dzenis Burnic:</strong> Underwhelming, nothing to write home about. 4/10
•   <strong>Dario Saric:</strong> Another unknown, potential to be a decent option but very unlikely. 4/10
•   <strong>Ivan Basic:</strong> Average midfielder, does what he should but nothing special. 5/10

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Edin Dzeko:</strong> Still a threat in front of goal, but his age is showing. 7/10
•   <strong>Ermedin Demirovic:</strong> Hard-working, but lacks the quality to consistently score. 6/10
•   <strong>Samed Bazdar:</strong> Very inexperienced to the squad, will probably not do much. 4/10
•   <strong>Haris Tabakovic:</strong> Will score here and there but nothing special. 5/10
•   <strong>Amar Memic:</strong> Underwhelming, nothing to write home about. 4/10
•   <strong>Luka Kulenovic:</strong> Underwhelming, nothing to write home about. 4/10

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5/10</strong>

This Bosnia squad is mediocre at best. They have a few decent players, but lack quality in key areas and their depth is questionable. They'll struggle against strong opposition and are unlikely to achieve anything significant. Dzeko is carrying them and the squad lacks any quality in general.</div>
