  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here we go, roasting this music opinion chart:

•   <strong>The Beatles at 100, picking "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" as the best track:</strong> Okay, boomer. Are you <em>really</em> going to pick the song that just drones on and on instead of literally anything else on Abbey Road? You are the reason people think classic rock is overrated.
•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness at 100:</strong> We get it, you're edgy. You like depressing music that sounds like it was recorded in a dumpster.
•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan and Nas at 100:</strong> Respectable, but also kind of basic. Everyone knows these are great albums. Where's the spice? The daring picks?
•   <strong>Madvillainy at 100:</strong> You probably think you're super underground for liking this, even though it's critically acclaimed and widely loved.
•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly at 100, "Momma" as the worst track?</strong> You are out of your MIND. "Momma" is a lyrical masterpiece. This is the worst take on the entire list.
•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here at 100, making the title track the WORST track??</strong> You want attention. There is no way you believe this.
•   <strong>Radiohead at 95:</strong> "Faust Arp" is the worst track on In Rainbows? Come on!
•   <strong>Mingus:</strong> Okay, now you're just trying to sound sophisticated. No one actually enjoys this album.
•   <strong>Bjork:</strong> "Sun In My Mouth" is the worst track? No way!
•   <strong>King Crimson at 90, "Moonchild" as the worst?</strong> Yeah, because anything experimental from the 60s is garbage, I guess...
•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! at 80:</strong> You only listen to this when you want to feel like the world is ending.
•   <strong>Jeff Buckley at 75:</strong> Overrated and depressing. You listen to this when you want to cry alone in your room.
•   <strong>Marvin Gaye at 75:</strong> What a joke, you rated this masterpiece the same as Jeff Buckley? Your soul is as empty as this score suggests.
•   <strong>The Microphones at 70:</strong> It's a solid album, but let's be real, it's kind of pretentious and lo-fi for the sake of being lo-fi.

Overall, this list is a mix of obvious choices, hipster bait, and questionable opinions that probably get you yelled at at parties. You need to branch out and stop trying so hard to impress people with your music taste.</div>
