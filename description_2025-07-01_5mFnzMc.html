  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercup, because I'm about to unleash the most brutally honest, no-BS football XI you've ever laid your eyes on. This ain't no popularity contest, it's pure, unadulterated skill and performance.

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3 (Because it's efficient and gets the job done)</strong>

<strong>Goalkeeper: Alisson Becker (Rating: 9/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> Consistently top-tier, saves you points, and doesn't crack under pressure. De Gea? Overrated. Donnarumma? Still too inconsistent.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Back: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Rating: 8.5/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> His crossing and vision from the right flank are unmatched. Defensively, he's improved enough to warrant a spot. Anyone who whines about his defense is just jealous.
•   <strong>Center Back: Virgil van Dijk (Rating: 9.5/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> The rock. The wall. The guy you want leading your line. When he's fit, he's practically impenetrable. No debate.
•   <strong>Center Back: Ruben Dias (Rating: 9/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> An absolute beast. Reads the game like a damn chess master, and his leadership qualities are off the charts. Plus, he adds a physical presence.
•   <strong>Left Back: Alphonso Davies (Rating: 8.5/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> Pure pace and attacking prowess. Yes, he can get caught out defensively, but his recovery speed is unreal. You need that extra zip going forward.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Midfield: Rodri (Rating: 9/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> Underrated. He shields the defense flawlessly, breaks up plays, and keeps the ball moving. Kante in his prime might have been better, but Rodri is the man right now.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Kevin De Bruyne (Rating: 9.5/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> The playmaker, the visionary, the goddamn pass master. His range of passing is insane, and he scores crucial goals. Who else can whip in a cross like that?
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Jude Bellingham (Rating: 9/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> He's got it all. Work rate, skill, and leadership. He's a complete midfielder who impacts every single game. Hype is real, deal with it.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Wing: Mohamed Salah (Rating: 9.5/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> Consistently delivers goals. His dribbling is mesmerizing, and he finishes with ruthless efficiency.
•   <strong>Center Forward: Erling Haaland (Rating: 10/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> A scoring machine. He's an absolute freak of nature, terrorizing defenses and netting goals for fun. If you don't pick him, you're just plain wrong.
•   <strong>Left Wing: Kylian Mbappé (Rating: 9.5/10)</strong>
•   <strong>Why?</strong> Pace, skill, and a killer instinct. He's the complete package. His speed leaves defenders in the dust, and his finishing is top-notch.

<strong>Manager: Pep Guardiola</strong>

•   <strong>Why?</strong> No need to explain this shit, just look at his trophy cabinet.

This is the team I would build to dominate any opposition, any day. This is not up for debate. If you have an issue, go cry about it somewhere else.</div>
