  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's stir up some trouble in this world! Here are 5 potential conflicts based on the provided map, focusing on minor countries and revolts:

1.  <strong>New England vs. Quebec:</strong> Tensions have been high due to trade disputes and border disagreements. Both sides are itching for a fight to secure resources and assert dominance in the region. This is bound to be a short but brutal one. 
2.  <strong>Araucan√≠a vs Argentina:</strong> Due to rising tensions of claims on land, war will break out in the region. It may not be a long war, but it will be one of the most savage ones in the south. 
3.  <strong>Somaliland vs Puntland:</strong> Somaliland needs access to the sea, and Puntland has it. They have been fighting for centuries, and they still are, this time it may be the big one to change everything.
4.  <strong>South Sudan vs Sudan:</strong> This is a classic, and it will never stop. It is bound to happen sooner or later for the 2 small countries.
5.  <strong>Kashmir vs. Pakistan:</strong> Pakistan needs to get revenge for getting stomped on last time, now is the best time for it. They need to fight for their homeland.</div>
