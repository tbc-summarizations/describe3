  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into this Estonian squad. No holding back here.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Karl Hein (Werder Bremen):</strong> 5/10. Playing in the Bundesliga is a plus, but he's not exactly lighting up the world. Probably their best option, but that doesn't say much.
•   <strong>Karl Andre Vallner (Levadia):</strong> 3/10. Playing in the Estonian league is a major red flag. Backup at best.
•   <strong>Matvei Igonen (Degerfors):</strong> 4/10. Playing in Sweden but not at a top club. Probably not much better than the local option.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Maksim Paskotsi (Gent):</strong> 5/10. In Belgium. Alright, but he's not exactly a world-beater.
•   <strong>Joonas Tamm (Sepsi):</strong> 4/10. Romanian league. Not good.
•   <strong>Märten Kuusk (GKS Katowice):</strong> 3/10. Poland league. Yikes
•   <strong>Rasmus Peetson (Levadia):</strong> 2/10. Estonian league. Should not be in the national team.
•   <strong>Tanel Tammik (Levadia):</strong> 2/10. Same as above.
•   <strong>Michael Schjönning-Larsen (Levadia):</strong> 2/10. Triple same as above.
•   <strong>Joseph Saliste (Paide):</strong> 2/10. Should not be near the national team
•   <strong>Edgar Tur (Levadia):</strong> 2/10. Should not be near the national team

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Mattias Käit (Thun):</strong> 5/10. Swiss league. Not the worst.
•   <strong>Rocco Shein (Fredrikstad):</strong> 4/10. Playing in Norway league.
•   <strong>Mihkel Ainsalu (Levadia):</strong> 3/10. See above.
•   <strong>Kevor Palumets (Zeleziarne Podbrezova):</strong> 4/10. Slovakia league. Nothing to get excited about.
•   <strong>Markus Soomets (IK Start):</strong> 3/10. Norway league. Not good.
•   <strong>Martin Miller (Paide):</strong> 3/10. See above.
•   <strong>Patrik Kristal (Köln II):</strong> 3/10. Okay, but only plays for the Second team of Köln.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Vlasiy Sinyavskiy (Bohemians 1905):</strong> 4/10. Czech league. Passable, at best.
•   <strong>Ioan Yakovlev (Panionios Athens):</strong> 3/10. The fact that he plays in Greece but for a non-top club team makes it an even bigger red flag.
•   <strong>Robi Saarma (Pardubice):</strong> 3/10. Other Czech League. Passable, at best.
•   <strong>Rauno Sappinen (Flora Tallinn):</strong> 4/10. Estonian league. Not much better than the others.
•   <strong>Henri Anier (Paide):</strong> 3/10. Past his prime.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

<strong>2/10.</strong>

This squad is pathetic. The vast majority of the players are in weak leagues. There's no real quality, no spark, nothing to suggest they'll be competitive against any decent opposition. This is bottom-tier international football.</div>
