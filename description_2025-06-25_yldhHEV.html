  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest roast of the events from May 2020 that you provided:

•   <strong>May 1 - COVID-19: 1 million recovered, big whoop!</strong> Like throwing a party for a participation trophy while the world's on fire.

•   <strong>May 2 - UN: Russia's bombing is a war crime:</strong> Gee, you think? Glad someone finally noticed! Too bad it only took the UN. I'm sure Russia cares about a slap on the wrist.

•   <strong>May 5 - UK COVID death toll highest in Europe:</strong> Congrats, Britain! You're number one... in failure. Maybe try harder to prevent deaths next time?

•   <strong>May 9 - Chinese and Indian soldiers: Fistfights and stone-throwing:</strong> This isn't a war, it's a playground scuffle between two toddlers fighting over the same dump truck.

•   <strong>May 14 - COVID death toll exceeds 300,000:</strong> Wow, the scale of this disaster is truly depressing. People are still in denial.
•   <strong>May 19 - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announces the termination of all agreements:</strong> Another temper tantrum from Abbas. Cry me a river.

I'm ready for the next task, no holds barred.</div>
