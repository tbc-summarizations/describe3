  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's assemble this squad, brutally honest and with no punches pulled. This is going to be a tough challenge given the disparity in quality across these nations, but we'll make the most of it. We're going to go with a 4-3-3 formation, aiming for some defensive solidity and hoping for moments of brilliance upfront.

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Mark Travers (Ireland):</strong> Travers is a decent keeper who starts for Bournemouth, a Premier League team. That alone gives him the edge over anyone else available. We need someone reliable between the posts, and he's the best we've got.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Back: Denzel Dumfries (Netherlands):</strong> No question here. Dumfries brings pace, power, and attacking intent. He's a top-quality right-back.
•   <strong>Center Back: Virgil van Dijk (Netherlands):</strong> The rock in our defense. Van Dijk is a world-class center-back with incredible leadership and defensive prowess. An automatic pick.
•   <strong>Center Back: Shane Duffy (Ireland):</strong> Look, options are limited. Duffy is physically imposing and will throw himself in front of anything. He needs to stay disciplined alongside Van Dijk, though.
•   <strong>Left Back: Theo Hernandez (France):</strong> One of the best left-backs in the world. Theo brings incredible pace, technique, and attacking quality.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Midfield: Aurélien Tchouaméni (France):</strong> Tchouaméni is a powerhouse in midfield. He's got the physicality, the tackling ability, and the passing range to control the game. An easy pick.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Frenkie de Jong (Netherlands):</strong> De Jong provides elegance and control in midfield. He's a master of possession and can dictate the tempo. He will be essential for linking defense and attack.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Jason Knight (Ireland):</strong> Limited options here. Knight is a hard worker and will put in a shift, but frankly, he's nowhere near the level of our other midfielders.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Wing: Antoine Griezmann (France):</strong> Griezmann offers a bit of everything – goals, creativity, and work rate. He'll drift inside, link up with the midfield, and provide a threat in the box.
•   <strong>Center Forward: Kylian Mbappé (France):</strong> Arguably the best player in the world. Mbappé's pace, skill, and finishing are unmatched. He will lead the line and terrify defenses.
•   <strong>Left Wing: Cody Gakpo (Netherlands):</strong> Gakpo brings pace, trickery, and an eye for goal. He's still developing but has the potential to be a real threat.

<strong>Manager:</strong>

•   <strong>Didier Deschamps (France):</strong> He knows how to win. We need a manager who can grind out results, even if the team isn't always playing beautiful football.

<strong>Tactical Approach:</strong>

•   Defensively, we're relying on Van Dijk to organize the backline and Tchouaméni to shield the defense.
•   In midfield, De Jong will be key to keeping possession and dictating the tempo.
•   Upfront, we'll be looking to Mbappé to provide the magic. Griezmann and Gakpo need to support him and contribute with goals and assists.

This lineup is heavily reliant on the French and Dutch players. Greece, Ireland, and especially Gibraltar simply don't have the quality to compete at the highest level. It's a pragmatic team built to be defensively solid and dangerous on the counter-attack.

Good luck to this team, they will need it.</div>
