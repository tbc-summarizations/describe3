  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this "Most Valuable XI" like a frog in biology class:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Gregor Kobel:</strong> (6/10) Decent shot-stopper, but prone to errors and lacks the commanding presence of a truly world-class keeper. Overrated.
•   <strong>Alphonso Davies:</strong> (8/10) Explosive pace and attacking threat. However, his defensive positioning can be questionable and relies too much on recovery speed.
•   <strong>Dayot Upamecano:</strong> (7/10) Physically imposing and capable on his day. Prone to brain farts and lapses in concentration that lead to costly mistakes. Needs consistency.
•   <strong>Kim Min-Jae:</strong> (8.5/10) A rock at the back. Strong, quick, and reads the game well. One of the few genuinely top-class defenders in the Bundesliga.
•   <strong>Josip Stanisic:</strong> (5/10) A utility player who fills in where needed. Lacks the quality to be a regular starter in a top team. Overrated due to playing for Bayern.
•   <strong>Joshua Kimmich:</strong> (9/10) A midfield metronome. Excellent passing range, work rate, and tactical intelligence. Occasionally struggles against physically dominant opponents.
•   <strong>Aleksandar Pavlovic:</strong> (5/10) Lacks defensive capabilities. Not a good fit for this team at all.
•   <strong>Luis Diaz:</strong> (4/10) Overrated signing. Not worth the hype.
•   <strong>Jamal Musiala:</strong> (9.5/10) A mesmerizing talent. Incredible dribbling, vision, and goal-scoring ability. Has the potential to become one of the best players in the world.
•   <strong>Michael Olise:</strong> (7/10) Tricky winger with a good eye for a pass. Can be inconsistent and needs to add more goals to his game.
•   <strong>Harry Kane:</strong> (9/10) A world-class striker. Excellent goal-scoring record, link-up play, and leadership qualities. The complete package.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

(6.5/10)

This team is heavily reliant on individual brilliance and has glaring weaknesses in the midfield and defense. The lack of a true defensive midfielder to partner Kimmich leaves them vulnerable. The defense, while talented, can be prone to errors. The attack is potent, but the team lacks balance and cohesion. They would struggle against well-organized and defensively solid opponents. A team full of potential, but ultimately flawed.</div>
