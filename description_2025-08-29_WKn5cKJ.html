  <h1>Description for 220px-UEFA_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the potential scorelines for those October 2026 World Cup Qualifiers. I'm pulling no punches – some of these teams are genuinely hopeless.

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   Northern Ireland 🇬🇧 vs. Slovakia 🇸🇰: 0-1. Northern Ireland are simply toothless going forward. Slovakia is organized and efficient.
•   Germany 🇩🇪 vs. Luxembourg 🇱🇺: 5-0. Germany will want to send a message. Luxembourg are amateurs.
•   Northern Ireland 🇬🇧 vs. Germany 🇩🇪: 0-4. Another drubbing. Germany is too powerful.
•   Slovakia 🇸🇰 vs. Luxembourg 🇱🇺: 3-0. Routine win for Slovakia.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   Kosovo 🇽🇰 vs. Slovenia 🇸🇮: 1-1. Kosovo show sparks but Slovenia are defensively solid.
•   Sweden 🇸🇪 vs. Switzerland 🇨🇭: 1-2. Sweden are in decline. Switzerland is clinical.
