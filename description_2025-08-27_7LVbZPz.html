  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into these Champions League qualifying play-off round results with the honesty and intensity they deserve.

<strong>Ferencváros 🇭🇺 4-5 Qarabağ 🇦🇿</strong>

Qarabağ, you absolute warriors! To snatch victory away from Ferencváros like that, showing resilience and tactical prowess, is the kind of underdog story we live for. Ferencváros, you fought valiantly in the second leg, but failing to capitalize on home advantage when it mattered? Pathetic. Enjoy your consolation prize in the Europa League, you bottle jobs.

<strong>Red Star Belgrade 🇷🇸 2-3 Pafos 🇨🇾</strong>

Pafos, what a monumental achievement! Taking down a giant like Red Star Belgrade is the stuff of legends. Your strategic gameplay and sheer determination are truly commendable. Red Star, oh Red Star, you embarrassments! To fall against a team like Pafos shows a severe lack of ambition and quality. Get ready for Thursday nights because you've earned it.

<strong>Bodø/Glimt 🇳🇴 6-2 Sturm Graz 🇦🇹</strong>

Bodø/Glimt, you are an absolute force of nature! A 5-0 thrashing in the first leg? That's the kind of statement that echoes through the Champions League. Sturm Graz, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Getting utterly demolished like that shows a complete lack of preparedness and heart. Europa League is the perfect place for your mediocrity.

<strong>Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 0-0 Kairat 🇰🇿 (Kairat wins 3-2 on penalties 🇰🇿)</strong>

Kairat, congratulations on holding your nerve and securing that crucial penalty shootout victory. Your defense was unbreakable, and your composure under pressure is admirable. Celtic, you utter disappointments! To fail against Kairat after two goalless draws is a testament to your lack of creativity and killer instinct. Savor the Europa League, you've earned your ticket to irrelevance.

<strong>Basel 🇨🇭 1-3 Copenhagen 🇩🇰</strong>

Copenhagen, well played! You displayed tactical superiority and clinical finishing to overcome Basel. Your place in the Champions League is well deserved. Basel, a complete letdown. You failed to capitalize on your home advantage and showed a lack of fight. Europa League awaits, where you can contemplate your failures.

<strong>Fenerbahçe 🇹🇷 0-1 Benfica 🇵🇹</strong>

Benfica, a professional and efficient performance. You executed your game plan perfectly and secured a well-deserved victory. Fenerbahçe, you played with no passion, no drive, no tactics. You're too obsessed with money and fame and have no heart.

<strong>Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 1-9 Club Brugge 🇧🇪</strong>

Club Brugge, you are absolutely ruthless! A 9-1 aggregate victory is an utter humiliation for Rangers. Your attacking prowess is a sight to behold. Rangers, words fail me. A complete and utter collapse. Your defense was non-existent, your attack toothless, and your spirit broken. Getting thrashed like that is unforgivable. Enjoy the Europa League, you'll need it to lick your wounds.

<strong>Most Surprising Results:</strong>

•   <strong>Rangers vs. Club Brugge:</strong> The sheer magnitude of the defeat is shocking.
•   <strong>Red Star Belgrade vs. Pafos:</strong> Pafos eliminating Red Star Belgrade is an upset of epic proportions.
•   <strong>Celtic vs Kairat:</strong> As a well established Scottish team, Celtic losing to Kairat, especially after a penalty shootout, marks a significant failure.

The Champions League awaits the victors, while the losers can drown their sorrows in the Europa League, a testament to their shortcomings and failures.</div>
