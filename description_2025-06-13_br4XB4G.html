  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these Kazakhstan upsets with the brutal honesty you crave:

1.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-1 Serbia (2007):</strong> Rating: 7/10. Serbia was a team on the rise back then, but prone to complacency. Kazakhstan snatching a win is a decent shock, but Serbia's inconsistency makes it slightly less monumental.

2.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-2 Belgium (2007):</strong> Rating: 6/10. Belgium at that time wasn't the powerhouse they are now. A draw is respectable, but hardly earth-shattering. Still, a point against a European side is something.

3.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-2 Poland (2016):</strong> Rating: 7/10. Poland, with Lewandowski, were clear favorites. A draw is a good result.

4.  <strong>Kazakhstan 3-0 Scotland (2019):</strong> Rating: 9/10. Scotland, despite their perennial underachievement, thought they were at least better than <em>this</em>. Kazakhstan ruthlessly exposing Scotland's lack of tactical acumen and poor morale is pure schadenfreude.

5.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-2 Ukraine (2021):</strong> Rating: 6/10. Ukraine should be easily won this match, even though they didn't.

6.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-1 Slovakia (2022):</strong> Rating: 7/10. Slovakia is a tough team to beat as they are very defensively sound and rarely concede. Winning against them is considered pretty good.

7.  <strong>Kazakhstan 2-1 Belarus (2022):</strong> Rating: 5/10. Belarus is garbage, a win here is as expected.

8.  <strong>Kazakhstan 3-2 Denmark (2023):</strong> Rating: 10/10. Denmark thought they could just stroll into Kazakhstan and pick up easy points. Kazakhstan, with a late comeback, shows a level of tactical awareness and determination. I would even call this a historic result.

9.  <strong>Kazakhstan 1-0 Northern Ireland (2023):</strong> Rating: 7/10. Northern Ireland are a mid-tier team, losing against them is not a surprise.

10. <strong>Finland 1-2 Kazakhstan (2023):</strong> Rating: 9/10. Finland is a strong team, with a good structure and organization of the team. Beating them is considered a feat.

There you have it. Brutally honest ratings, as requested. Kazakhstan's journey has been a mix of capitalizing on opponents' weaknesses and genuine moments of brilliance.</div>
