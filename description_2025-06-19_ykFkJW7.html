  <h1>Description for 180.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here's my brutally honest assessment of this Uzbekistan squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Abduvokhid Nematov (Nasaf):</strong> 73 clean sheets at 24 is decent. Shows potential, but still relatively unproven. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Utkir Yusupov (Foolad):</strong> 112 clean sheets is a solid number. However, at 34, he's likely past his prime. Might still be a reliable backup. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Abduvokhid Nematov (Neftchi):</strong> The same name as the first goalkeeper is strange and sus. Regardless, only 52 clean sheets and 29 is underwhelming at this stage. <strong>4/10</strong>

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Abdukodir Khusanov (Manchester City):</strong> Being at Man City <em>sounds</em> impressive, but at 21, he's likely a youth player who has never featured for the first team. Stats are mediocre for a CB. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Khusniddin Alikulov (Caykur Rizespor):</strong> 18 goals and 7 assists are OK for a CB in Turkey. Nothing crazy, but not bad. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Rustam Ashurmatov (Rubin Kazan):</strong> Another average CB, decent amount of goals in Russia, but not someone who will carry the team. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Umar Eshmurodov (Nasaf):</strong> Low stats even for a CB, plays in the Uzbek league at 32 which isn't competitive. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Islom Tukhtakhuzhaev (OKMK Olmaliq):</strong> Plenty of goals for the Uzbek league, but is playing in the same league as Eshmurodov at 35, not impressive at all. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sherzod Nasrullaev (Nasaf):</strong> Mediocre goals, quite a few assists for a defender. Solid for a defender playing in Uzbekistan. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Farrukh Sayfiev (Neftchi):</strong> Goals and assists are great for a fullback! But playing in Uzbekistan and 34 years old is not impressive at all. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Khozhiakbar Alizhonov (Pakhtakor):</strong> Pretty good assists for a fullback! But playing in the Uzbek league at 28 doesn't mean much. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Odildzhon Khamrobekov (Bunyodkor):</strong> Awful stats for a midfielder, nothing to write home about. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Abdulla Abdullaev (Pakhtakor):</strong> Also, terrible stats, nothing positive here. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Abdurauf Buriev (Pakhtakor):</strong> Even worse stats than the previous 2! This is horrific. <strong>1/10</strong>
•   <strong>Akmal Mozgovoy (Nasaf):</strong> Playing in Uzbekistan, the stats are average. Needs to leave the country to improve and prove himself. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Azizbek Turgunboev (Sivasspor):</strong> Respectable stats for a midfielder in Turkey! Looks like the only decent midfielder so far. <strong>7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Abbosbek Fayzullaev (CSKA Moscow):</strong> Pretty good stats in Uzbekistan, and he is now playing in Russia! Great potential and good enough to carry the midfield. <strong>7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Jamshid Iskanderov (Neftchi):</strong> Great stats across the board, but he is 31 and plays in Uzbekistan so is not anything special. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Khozhimat Erkinov (Al-Wahda):</strong> Average stats, and playing in the UAE Pro League. Needs to move to a tougher league if he is serious. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Jaloliddin Masharipov (Esteghlal):</strong> Great stats but playing in Iran's league at 31 is a huge red flag. Should've left the country sooner. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ruslanbek Jiyanov (Navbahor):</strong> Average stats and still playing in Uzbekistan. Needs to improve drastically. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Eldor Shomurodov (Roma):</strong> Terrible goals and assists for a Roma player, shows how bad he is. Only upside is that he plays in Europe. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Igor Sergeev (Pakhtakor):</strong> Okay, 182 goals is HUGE. But he is 32 and still plays in Uzbekistan? This is horrendous and is a terrible look. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

This squad is incredibly underwhelming. Way too many players playing in Uzbekistan. A few decent players in Turkey and Russia, but it's not enough. They are likely cannon fodder for most international teams. I'd give them a <strong>3/10</strong>. They seriously need to get their players playing in better leagues if they want to improve as a national team.</div>
