  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are five countries/revolts I've removed from the map. I've chosen these based on how unstable/likely they are to change:

1.  <strong>"Kurdistan" (in the Middle East):</strong> This region has been a hotbed of conflict for decades. Given the power dynamics of the surrounding nations (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria), the chance of it maintaining a lasting "de-facto" independence seems slim.
2.  <strong>Catalonia (in Spain):</strong> While there's a strong independence movement, the Spanish government has consistently quashed attempts at secession. It's unlikely to be recognized as a separate entity in the near future.
3.  <strong>Donetsk/Luhansk (in Ukraine):</strong> These regions in eastern Ukraine are heavily contested and dependent on external support (namely, Russia). Their long-term status is highly uncertain given ongoing geopolitical tensions.
4.  <strong>Western Sahara:</strong> The status of Western Sahara is a long-standing dispute. It is controlled by Morocco, but the Polisario Front seeks independence. It's unlikely to achieve definitive recognition.
5.  <strong>"Azawad" (in Mali):</strong> A region that has seen Tuareg separatist movements, it is unlikely to maintain any real independence against the central government of Mali.</div>
