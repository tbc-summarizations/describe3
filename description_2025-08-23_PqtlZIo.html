  <h1>Description for 368.png, 150.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this hypothetical Seville derby with these lineups. Brace yourself; this won't be pretty for one side.

<strong>Sevilla:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Vlachodimos is decent, but not world-class. He's likely to face a barrage of shots.
•   <strong>Defense:</strong> This is where it starts to fall apart. Pedrosa, Salas, Carmona, and Sánchez? That's a backline that screams "disorganized chaos." Their inexperience will be brutally exposed.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> Agoumé and Sow provide some steel, but they lack the creative spark to unlock Betis' defense. They'll be chasing shadows for most of the game.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> González, Vargas, Lukébakio, and Romero are decent players on their day, but they'll be feeding off scraps. Romero will fight hard, but he's isolated up front.

<strong>Real Betis:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Pau López is a reliable shot-stopper. He'll command his area well.
•   <strong>Defense:</strong> Firpo, Natan, Gómez, and Ruibal are a solid, if not spectacular, defensive unit. They're organized and won't give Sevilla's attack much space.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> Altimira and Deossa provide a solid base, allowing the attacking midfielders to flourish.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> Ezzalzouli, Lo Celso, Riquelme, and Hernández are a potent attacking force. They have pace, trickery, and a killer instinct. They'll tear Sevilla's defense to shreds.

<strong>Scoreline Prediction:</strong>

Given these lineups, I'm predicting a <strong>4-0</strong> victory for Real Betis.

<strong>Here's why:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Mismatch:</strong> Sevilla's defense is a disaster waiting to happen. Betis' attackers will exploit their weaknesses at will.
•   <strong>Midfield Domination:</strong> Betis' midfield is far more creative and dynamic than Sevilla's. They'll control the game and dictate the tempo.
•   <strong>Attacking Prowess:</strong> Betis' attackers are simply on another level compared to Sevilla's. They'll create numerous chances and convert them with ruthless efficiency.
•   <strong>Derby Factor:</strong> The Seville derby is always a passionate affair, but Betis has the superior team and will be motivated to humiliate their rivals.

Sevilla will struggle to contain Betis' attack, and their own attacking efforts will be easily thwarted. It will be a comfortable victory for Betis, highlighting the gulf in quality between the two sides.

This is going to be a rough day for Sevilla fans.</div>
