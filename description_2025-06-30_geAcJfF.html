  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic attempt to smear Taco's name, shall we? This reeks of a bitter ex-friend with an axe to grind.

<strong>"Yellow banned memes from general and regularly abused his power."</strong>

Oh, boo-hoo. Grow up. Managing a server isn't a democracy; it's a dictatorship with benevolent intentions. Sometimes, you need to make unpopular decisions for the greater good. Maybe "general" was being flooded with garbage memes that were driving away serious users. And "regularly abused his power"? That's just a vague, whiny accusation. Where's the proof? Show me concrete examples of this so-called abuse instead of relying on feelings.

<strong>"Taco trusting Yellow over other people cost him the server."</strong>

Let's get one thing straight: Taco's server, Taco's choice. If Taco trusted Yellow's judgment, that's their prerogative. Maybe Yellow had the server's best interests at heart. Maybe the "other people" were a bunch of crybabies who couldn't handle the truth. Either way, blaming Yellow for the server's downfall is a lazy cop-out.

<strong>"Here are screenshots of Yellow’s actions:"</strong>

Ah, the "evidence." Let's break it down:

•   <strong>"I don't wanna brag about it."</strong> Classic deflection. Yellow's actions speak for themselves. He claims he doesn't want to brag, but he immediately follows it up with a statement that sounds like a brag. Classic manipulation tactic.
•   <strong>"You know what, if you keep talking about this, you dont respect my choices. Just deal with it. You dont like it, just leave."</strong> So? Yellow's not a therapist, he's a server manager. If someone is constantly harping on his decisions and creating drama, he has every right to tell them to shut up or leave. It's called setting boundaries, something these whiners clearly struggle with.
•   <strong>"Have you learned nothing."</strong> Maybe Red is just too stupid to understand the explanation, or keeps making the same mistake, so Yellow is annoyed that Red hasn't learned anything.
•   <strong>"What the fuck are you on about...Are you allergic to criticism?"</strong>
    Oh, the horror! A little harsh language. So what? Sometimes, you need to cut through the BS and get straight to the point. And the question about being "allergic to criticism" is valid. Red is likely being overly sensitive and can't handle anyone disagreeing with him.
•   <strong>"Its just stricting the rules and banning someone."</strong>
    Yes. Yellow is admitting he is doing something that is necessary and good, as if Red did something bad he should be banned.

<strong>"Here are screenshots of Yellow abusing his admin powers and demoting Red for criticizing him."</strong>

A-HA! The smoking gun! Demotion for criticism. Here's the thing: Criticism isn't a protected right. If Red's "criticism" was actually just toxic, unproductive whining, then Yellow was completely justified in demoting him. And let's be honest, based on the tone of these screenshots, that's exactly what it was.

In conclusion, this entire case is a pathetic attempt to smear Yellow's name. It's based on vague accusations, selective screenshots, and a whole lot of butthurt feelings. Taco and Yellow are not guilty of anything besides being effective server managers. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have better things to do than argue with a bunch of whiny children.</div>
