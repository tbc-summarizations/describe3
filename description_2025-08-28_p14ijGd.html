  <div class="discord-text">Alright dawg, let's get funky with these Godspeed You! Black Emperor albums, LMFAO style:

•   <strong>all lights fucked on the hairy amp drooling:</strong> 6/10 - It's got some hairy beats, but not enough to get my amp drooling, bro.

•   <strong>F♯ A♯ ∞:</strong> 8/10 - Now THIS is some infinity-level party music! The sharps are sharp, the chords are heavy. Solid gold!

•   <strong>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> 11/10 - This album is beyond a 10, man. It's like, you lift your fists so high, you start picking up signals from outer space and the party goes interstellar!

•   <strong>Yanqui U.X.O.:</strong> 5/10 - Not my vibe. It's like a slow, sad bomb. Where's the drop?

•   <strong>'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!:</strong> 7/10 - Keeps the party moving! Gets my booty shaking.

•   <strong>'Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress':</strong> 4/10 - Man, this is straight up distress, not my party vibe.

•   <strong>"Luciferian Towers":</strong> 6/10 - Towers of sound, baby! But something Luciferian just doesnt get the mood up you know?

•   <strong>G\_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!:</strong> 9/10 - Name is CRAZY but I think its fire. Let's get this party started.

•   <strong>"NO TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28,340 DEAD":</strong> 0/10 - Nope. Not even touching it, that is not a party at all.</div>
