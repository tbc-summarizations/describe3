  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest, extremely detailed breakdown of Liverpool's Champions League group stage predictions you asked for:

<strong>Home Matches:</strong>

•   <strong>Liverpool vs. Real Madrid:</strong> Liverpool 3 - 2 Real Madrid. A high-octane match. Liverpool's attack is relentless at Anfield, but Real Madrid's experience and individual brilliance ensure they won't go down without a fight. Vinicius Junior will cause problems, but Liverpool's midfield dominance will be the key.
•   <strong>Liverpool vs. Atlético Madrid:</strong> Liverpool 2 - 0 Atlético Madrid. Simeone's tactics are a nightmare away from home, but Liverpool will find a way. Atlético will try to suffocate the game, but Liverpool's pressing will break through eventually.
•   <strong>Liverpool vs. PSV Eindhoven:</strong> Liverpool 5 - 1 PSV Eindhoven. This one is going to be a bloodbath. PSV has some exciting attacking talent, but defensively they are paper-thin. Liverpool will exploit this mercilessly. Expect a Salah hat-trick.
•   <strong>Liverpool vs. Qarabağ:</strong> Liverpool 7 - 0 Qarabağ. No mercy. Qarabağ are out of their depth at this level. Liverpool will use this as a training exercise to boost their goal difference.

<strong>Away Matches:</strong>

•   <strong>Inter Milan vs. Liverpool:</strong> Inter Milan 1 - 1 Liverpool. A tense, tactical affair at the San Siro. Inter's defense is well-drilled, and Liverpool will struggle to break them down. A late equalizer from a set-piece will salvage a point for Liverpool.
•   <strong>Eintracht Frankfurt vs. Liverpool:</strong> Eintracht Frankfurt 0 - 3 Liverpool. Frankfurt's stadium is intimidating, but their team is not. Liverpool will control the game from start to finish. A comfortable win with goals from open play and set pieces.
•   <strong>Marseille vs. Liverpool:</strong> Marseille 2 - 4 Liverpool. Chaos in France. Marseille's attack is dangerous, but their defense is a disaster waiting to happen. Liverpool will exploit their vulnerabilities on the counter-attack. Expect a thrilling, end-to-end game.
•   <strong>Galatasaray vs. Liverpool:</strong> Galatasaray 1 - 2 Liverpool. Hellish atmosphere in Istanbul. Galatasaray's fans are among the most passionate in the world, but Liverpool's experience will see them through. A late goal from a substitute will seal a hard-fought victory for Liverpool.</div>
