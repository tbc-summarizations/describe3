  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these match results! Buckle up, because I'm holding nothing back.

•   <strong>Lithuania 🇱🇹 0-2 Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Lithuania, seriously? Losing at home to Norway? You're practically gifting points away. Norway, good job, but beating Lithuania is like dunking on a toddler. Not exactly a feat of strength.

•   <strong>Belarus 🇧🇾 1-2 Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> Belarus, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Scotland, you barely edged out a win against a mediocre team. Don't get too cocky.

•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹 3-2 Slovakia 🇸🇰:</strong> Austria, a narrow escape against Slovakia? Should've been a more decisive victory. Slovakia, respectable effort, but losing is still losing.

•   <strong>Cyprus 🇨🇾 0-3 Kosovo 🇽🇰:</strong> Cyprus, getting thrashed at home by Kosovo? Embarrassing. Kosovo, nice win, but let's see if you can keep it up against better competition.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 0-2 Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> Kazakhstan, expected to lose, and they delivered. Sweden, a routine win against a weak opponent. Yawn.

•   <strong>Iceland 🇮🇸 2-2 Faroe Islands 🇫🇴:</strong> Iceland, a draw against the Faroe Islands? What happened to the Viking spirit? Faroe Islands, a surprising draw. Enjoy the moment, it probably won't last.

•   <strong>Montenegro 🇲🇪 0-1 Russia 🇷🇺:</strong> Montenegro, you managed to lose to Russia? Pathetic. Russia, a narrow win against a nobody. Don't expect a parade.

•   <strong>Andorra 🇦🇩 0-2 Israel 🇮🇱:</strong> Andorra, at least you didn't get completely humiliated. Israel, you beat Andorra. Congratulations, you did what you were supposed to do.

•   <strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮 3-0 Liechtenstein 🇱🇮:</strong> Slovenia, good job beating Liechtenstein! What a mighty achievement! This win will be written down in history books! Liechtenstein, as always - good for a laugh.

•   <strong>Czechia 🇨🇿 3-0 Albania 🇦🇱:</strong> Czechia, finally a decisive win. Albania, you were outclassed. Pack your bags.

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷 1-0 Moldova 🇲🇩:</strong> Greece, barely squeezing out a win against Moldova? You're better than this. Moldova, close, but no cigar. Try harder.

•   <strong>Armenia 🇦🇲 0-3 Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> Armenia, utterly destroyed by Serbia. What a joke! Serbia, a dominant win. Now do it against someone who matters.

•   <strong>Latvia 🇱🇻 2-1 Finland 🇫🇮:</strong> Latvia, finally, a win! Celebrate while it lasts, because it's a rare occurrence. Finland, losing to Latvia? Unacceptable.

•   <strong>Ukraine 🇺🇦 2-0 Luxembourg 🇱🇺:</strong> Ukraine, expected win. Luxembourg, you were just there to make up the numbers.

•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴 1-1 Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> Romania, a draw? How lame! Poland, you could've done better.

•   <strong>Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 2-1 Gibraltar 🇬🇮:</strong> Azerbaijan, barely scraping by against Gibraltar? You should be ashamed. Gibraltar, a valiant effort, but you're still Gibraltar.

•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰 0-1 Denmark 🇩🇰:</strong> North Macedonia, another loss to add to the pile. Denmark, a boring, predictable win.

•   <strong>Northern Ireland 🇬🇧 4-2 Malta 🇲🇹:</strong> Northern Ireland, finally a goal-fest! Malta, at least you scored.

•   <strong>Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 1-2 Georgia 🇬🇪:</strong> Wales, losing to Georgia? Embarrassing! Georgia, a surprising win. Enjoy the moment, it won't happen often.

•   <strong>San Marino 🇸🇲 0-2 Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> San Marino, at least you didn't lose by more. Bosnia, beating San Marino is like shooting fish in a barrel.

•   <strong>Bulgaria 🇧🇬 2-0 Ireland 🇮🇪:</strong> Bulgaria, good job, actually winning something! Ireland, another disappointing result.

•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪 2-2 Turkey 🇹🇷:</strong> Estonia, a draw against Turkey? Not bad. Turkey, you should have won this. What a blunder!

There you go. Roasted, toasted, and served. Next time, give me some real matches to dissect!</div>
