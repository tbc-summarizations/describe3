  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you want a brutally honest take on these albums as if I were living in the 1970s? Buckle up.

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> (Inaudible sputtering) What in the unholy name of psychedelics is this Icelandic garbage? This is like the soundtrack to a nightmare I had after eating too much bad acid at Woodstock. Get this noise away from me. (Rating: Avoid at all costs, hippie nonsense)

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> Now THIS is more like it! Bowie's got the swagger, the glam, and the tunes! He's pushing boundaries, but in a way that's catchy and cool. He is the future of music! (Rating: A revolutionary masterpiece!)

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> Okay, I'm all for experimentation, but this is just self-indulgent noise. Endless instrumental rambling. Who has the time or patience for this? (Rating: Pure pretentious drivel. Turn it off.)

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> Depressing music. This is definitely not a good idea, makes me want to kill myself.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> Too melodramatic. It's okay, but this is boring and sounds like screaming and crying, it feels like the artist is having some form of a breakdown.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> I think the artist is trying to have fun here but the beat is too weird. I would not listen to this.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> Now this is progressive rock done right! Moody, complex, and atmospheric. It takes you on a journey. Even if you are driving to work. (Rating: A stone-cold classic! Listen under the stars.)

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> Honestly, this is a bit all over the place. It's like she's trying to do too much at once. I think it can make her and her record label some money.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> What is this trash? I have no idea what's going on here.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> Marvin's hitting some heavy truths here, and it's beautiful. A soul album that speaks to the times. It's a shame so many are not hearing it. (Rating: Essential listening. Gets your head right.)

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> Mingus, he knows it and he is able to turn that into music. That man knows how to play, and this is jazz that demands to be listened to (Rating: Mind-blowing.)

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> I cannot listen to this. This is noise to me.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> Floyd is starting to get a little too spacey, but this album has some solid moments. Good for a late night when you are in a dark room.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> He is not a good person. I hate his music and who he is.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> Radiohead? It is okay. Not horrible.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> Stevie can do no wrong. This is a musical gift. A joyous, soulful masterpiece. (Rating: Pure sunshine in vinyl form! Get this in your collection ASAP.)

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> A band to make you break your speakers. It feels like angry teenagers trying to change the world.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> This is a must have, one of the best to ever do it. I am not going to get into it.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> This is the worst thing I have ever heard. I would never listen to this.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> Wu-Tang? More like Wu-Tang-CRAP! I feel like these guys are annoying and will get no where in life.

There you have it. Brutally honest opinions from a jaded 1970s music fan. Some of these would've been hits, others would've bombed hard!</div>
