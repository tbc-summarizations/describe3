  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this UEFA Nations League B Group 3 performance with the brutal honesty it deserves:

<strong>Group Overview:</strong>

Norway <strong>deserved</strong> that promotion to League A. Their performance was the most consistent, led by Erling Haaland and co, they consistently delivered, even if they had that hiccup against Austria. 
Austria, while a decent team, I expected better than securing a spot in the promotion play-offs only. They had some decent performances such as those of Matchday 3 and 4, but they could not edge out Norway at the top.

Slovenia are just... there. Qualified to the relegation play-offs. Very mediocre overall. Can't say I'm surprised with the likes of Jan Oblak on the team. They had a few good moments, such as beating Kazakhstan, but they were outclassed.
Kazakhstan, absolute embarrassment. Relegated to League C with a single point and a goal difference of -15. 0 goals scored? Pathetic. They were clearly outmatched and did not belong in this group. An utter disgrace to football. 

<strong>Matchday Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Matchday 1:</strong> Kazakhstan actually managed a draw against Norway. Unbelievable. Slovenia and Austria were even.
•   <strong>Matchday 2:</strong> Norway shows their dominance and Slovenia, well, they just beat a team that has zero goals scored.
•   <strong>Matchday 3:</strong> Austria demolishes Kazakhstan to show who is better and Norway did the same to Slovenia.
•   <strong>Matchday 4:</strong> A weird matchday for Norway since they fell to Austria 5-1 and Kazakhstan actually loses by only 1 goal.
•   <strong>Matchday 5:</strong> Just Austria doing Austria things. Slovenia also doing what they can against Norway, but it's a heavy defeat.
•   <strong>Matchday 6:</strong> Austria and Slovenia tie the match while Norway just ends this league in a heavy defeat against Kazakhstan.

<strong>Overall Opinion:</strong>

This group was a mix of the expected and the disappointing. Norway earned their promotion, and Kazakhstan deserved their relegation. The other teams just floated around. A relatively unexciting group overall, with only a few standout moments. Nothing exceptional to remember.</div>
