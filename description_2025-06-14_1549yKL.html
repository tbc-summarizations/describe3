  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's assemble this frankly mediocre XI from Israel, Bosnia, Ukraine, and Iceland. I'm not pulling any punches here – this lineup has some serious weaknesses. We'll go with a 4-3-3 formation because that's the least likely to expose all our defensive frailties:

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Asmir Begović (Bosnia):</strong> He's old, but still probably the best keeper of the lot. Time hasn't been kind, but experience counts for something in a team like this.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Back: Elías Rafn Ólafsson (Iceland):</strong> We're scraping the barrel here. Olaffson offers at least some positional awareness and a willingness to put in a shift, but don't expect miracles.
•   <strong>Center Back: Amir Rrahmani (Kosovo - but he could play for Bosnia):</strong> He is currently playing for Napoli, this is not the best but one of the only good players that this selection of country has to offer.
•   <strong>Center Back: Sverrir Ingi Ingason (Iceland):</strong> He's tall. That's about the only positive I can offer. Expect him to be caught out for pace and struggle with any remotely tricky forward.
•   <strong>Left Back: Vitaliy Mykolenko (Ukraine):</strong> One of the better players available here, at least. He's relatively solid defensively and can get forward a bit, but he won't be setting the world on fire.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Midfielder: Rade Krunić (Bosnia):</strong> A decent enough player, but nothing spectacular. He'll screen the defense, hopefully without making too many glaring errors.
•   <strong>Central Midfielder: Gylfi Sigurðsson (Iceland):</strong> His peak is long behind him, and he's been through a lot of personal stuff. If he's anywhere near his best, he adds creativity. If not, he's a passenger.
•   <strong>Central Midfielder: Manor Solomon (Israel):</strong> Arguably the most talented player in this entire squad. He's got the skill to unlock defenses, but needs to be consistently motivated.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Wing: Andri Guðjohnsen (Iceland):</strong> Yes, he's Eiður Guðjohnsen's son. No, he isn't anywhere near as good. Might get lucky with a shot now and then.
•   <strong>Center Forward: Eran Zahavi (Israel):</strong> A veteran goalscorer. He's probably past his prime, but he's the only likely source of goals in this team.
•   <strong>Left Wing: Mykhailo Mudryk (Ukraine):</strong> An extremely talented player, with one fatal flaw: he is yet to reach his full potential. He has all the tools in the world to get into the top-20 players one day but still has to work on a lot.

<strong>Manager:</strong>

•   Honestly, anyone who can get this bunch to play as a cohesive unit deserves a medal. Maybe a seasoned pragmatist who can drill them defensively.

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

This team would struggle against any remotely decent opposition. The defense is slow and prone to errors, the midfield lacks dynamism, and the attack is overly reliant on Zahavi pulling something out of the bag. Mudryk and Solomon are really the only players with the ability to consistently threaten. We'd be praying for set-pieces and counter-attacks. This lineup would be lucky to avoid relegation in most competitive leagues.</div>
