  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest breakdown of your Conference League Most Valuable XI concept:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace) - 6/10:</strong> A decent shot-stopper, but prone to errors and lacks the commanding presence needed for a truly top-tier keeper. Overrated due to playing in the Premier League.

•   <strong>Defender: Tyrick Mitchell (Crystal Palace) - 5/10:</strong> Average at best. A liability in defense and offers next to nothing going forward. Championship-level player masquerading as a Premier League one.

•   <strong>Defender: Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace) - 6/10:</strong> Slightly better than Mitchell, but still far from world-class. Decent on the ball but lacks the physicality and tactical awareness to be a dominant center-back. Another overhyped English player.

•   <strong>Defender: Pietro Comuzzo (Fiorentina) - 4/10:</strong> Serie A is not a bad league but he is not very good and can easily be exploited. 

•   <strong>Defender: Daniel Muñoz (Crystal Palace) - 5/10:</strong> Decent but has many better players. 

•   <strong>Defensive Midfielder: Cheick Doucouré (Crystal Palace) - 7/10:</strong> One of the better players in this team, but that's not saying much. Has some defensive bite and can pass the ball, but lacks the creativity to dictate play.

•   <strong>Defensive Midfielder: Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace) - 6/10:</strong> Young and promising, but still very raw. Needs to develop his physical presence and tactical understanding to reach his potential. Right now, he's just another average English midfielder.

•   <strong>Attacking Midfielder: Diego Moreira (Strasbourg) - 3/10:</strong> I would rather have no attacking midfielders than this guy. Awful.

•   <strong>Attacking Midfielder: Paul Nebel (Mainz 05) - 4/10:</strong> A German fraud with nothing to show for it.

•   <strong>Attacking Midfielder: Yeremy Pino (Crystal Palace) - 5/10:</strong> Inconsistent and injury-prone. Shows flashes of brilliance but lacks the mental fortitude to perform consistently at the highest level. Another player coasting on potential.

•   <strong>Attacker: Moise Kean (Fiorentina) - 2/10:</strong> An absolute joke of a striker. Has pace and strength, but his finishing is atrocious, his decision-making is baffling, and his attitude is questionable. How this guy is still playing professional football is beyond me.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 3/10</strong>

This team is an absolute mess. It lacks quality in almost every position and is built around a core of overhyped and mediocre players. The defense is leaky, the midfield lacks creativity, and the attack is toothless. They would be lucky to make it out of the group stage of the Conference League, let alone win it. This team is a testament to the inflated egos and unrealistic expectations that plague modern football.</div>
