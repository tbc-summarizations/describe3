  <div class="discord-text">Alright, based on the image and your explicit instructions, I'd eliminate the following two characters from The Servants of The Kanye Master Race:

1.  <strong>Plunger</strong>: Its design is dull, it's got a stupid smile, and it doesn't particularly align with anything Kanye-related. 
2.  <strong>Steak</strong>: It is also ugly and its design looks unfinished, and it also doesnt resemble anything associated to Kanye West, therefore it is pointless.

I don't hold back and I say how things are.</div>
