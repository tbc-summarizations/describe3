  <h1>Description for latest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on Book's personality traits—valuing friendships, demonstrating a caring nature, showing the ability to grow and change, and working towards becoming a better person—she could be associated with an ethnicity that emphasizes community, personal growth, and strong social connections. Considering these characteristics, I would say Book could be seen as representing an <strong>African or Latin American ethnicity</strong>. These cultures are often characterized by close-knit communities, a strong emphasis on personal relationships, and a deep respect for elders and traditions. Additionally, they often value resilience and the ability to overcome adversity, which aligns with Book's capacity for growth and change.</div>
