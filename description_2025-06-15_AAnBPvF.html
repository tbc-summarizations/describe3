  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down Tobol's hypothetical Champions League run and how they stack up:

<strong>League Phase:</strong>

•   <strong>Royal Antwerp 3-3 Tobol:</strong> Rating: 6/10. A draw away is decent, but conceding three to Antwerp is a red flag. A stronger team would shut that down.
•   <strong>Tobol 3-1 Sturm Graz:</strong> Rating: 7/10. Home win against a theoretically weaker opponent is expected. Nothing spectacular.
•   <strong>Monaco 1-1 Tobol:</strong> Rating: 7.5/10. Securing a draw away against Monaco is a respectable result, shows some tactical resilience.
•   <strong>Tobol 2-0 Liverpool:</strong> Rating: 9/10. Massive upset. Shutting out Liverpool is incredible. Indicates potential.
•   <strong>Anderlecht 1-3 Tobol:</strong> Rating: 7.5/10. Solid away win, shows consistency, but Anderlecht isn't what they used to be.
•   <strong>Tobol 1-1 RB Salzburg:</strong> Rating: 6.5/10. A home draw is okay, but Salzburg is beatable. Not a great result.
•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen 4-1 Tobol:</strong> Rating: 3/10. A brutal defeat. Shows vulnerability and lack of ability to deal with high-level pressing.
•   <strong>Tobol 3-1 Chelsea:</strong> Rating: 8/10. Redemption game. Beating Chelsea is a major statement, but Chelsea might be in turmoil so rating is not a 9.

<strong>Round of 16:</strong>

•   <strong>PSV Eindhoven 0-2 Tobol:</strong> Rating: 8.5/10. Winning away with a clean sheet in the first leg is tactically brilliant.
•   <strong>Tobol 1-1 PSV Eindhoven:</strong> Rating: 6/10. Doing enough to get the job done, shows maturity, but home draw against PSV is not acceptable.

<strong>Quarter-finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Sporting CP 3-1 Tobol:</strong> Rating: 5/10. Losing away isn't the end of the world, but conceding three shows defensive flaws.
•   <strong>Tobol 2-0 Sporting CP (Sporting wins 4-3 on penalties):</strong> Rating: 7/10. Fighting back to level the tie is admirable. Losing on penalties is just luck.

<strong>Overall Champions League Performance:</strong> 7/10

<strong>Surprise Factor:</strong>

This run is seriously unbelievable. Tobol, from Kazakhstan, beating Liverpool and Chelsea, and getting to the Quarter-finals? It's beyond any reasonable expectation.

•   <strong>The Liverpool and Chelsea wins:</strong> Those victories are the stuff of legends. It suggests either some serious tactical genius or the other teams were in a bad place.
•   <strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Their performance in the League Phase had moments of brilliance mixed with mediocrity, which is expected from a team of this level.
•   <strong>Tactical Adaptability:</strong> Reaching the quarter-finals shows they are not a one-trick pony. They were able to adapt their game plan based on the opponents, which is impressive.
•   <strong>Penalty Shootout Loss:</strong> Losing to Sporting on penalties is a painful way to go out, but it proves that they are capable of going toe-to-toe with established European teams.

In conclusion, Tobol had an incredible run in Champions League, far exceeding any realistic expectation.</div>
