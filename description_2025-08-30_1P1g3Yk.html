  <div class="discord-text">Alright, alright, alright, let's get this Cure-a-thon rollin'. Smash Mouth's comin' at ya with some straight-up, no-chaser opinions, brother!

•   <strong>Three Imaginary Boys:</strong> 6/10 - It's got that raw, garage band energy, but it's kinda like raw cookie dough. Needs a little sugar, ya know?

•   <strong>Seventeen Seconds:</strong> 4/10 - Talk about a downer! This album's like a cloudy day at the beach. Too much mood, not enough jam.

•   <strong>Faith:</strong> 3/10 - More like "Faith-lessly Boring"! This one's a total snooze-fest. Where's the party at?

•   <strong>Pornography:</strong> 2/10 - Okay, this is just depressing. Like, did someone steal their surfboard and their girlfriend at the same time?

•   <strong>The Top:</strong> 5/10 - Okay, this is like they took some happy pills and listened to a circus. It's fun, but way too out there!

•   <strong>The Head on the Door:</strong> 8/10 - Now we're talkin'! This album's got some sunshine in its soul. "Close to Me" is a total jam!

•   <strong>Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me:</strong> 9/10 - Woah! This album is stacked with bangers! This album slaps! "Just Like Heaven" is a total summer anthem!

•   <strong>Disintegration:</strong> 7/10 - It's got the feels, man, but this could be a real classic if they had one less long song!

•   <strong>Wish:</strong> 10/10 - There is not a single bad song on here. Classic all time album.

•   <strong>Wild Mood Swings:</strong> 4/10 - You can tell they lost a lot of steam when they released this. Should have stopped after Wish.

•   <strong>Bloodflowers:</strong> 6/10 - Eh, a solid ok album.

•   <strong>The Cure:</strong> 6/10 - I think this one just lacks identity.

•   <strong>4:13 Dream:</strong> 5/10 - One of the most disappointing albums of all time. How do you go from wish to this.

•   <strong>Songs of a Lost World:</strong> 7/10 - Not the worst album. Not the best. Decent overall, but could have been better!

Alright, that's all folks! The Cure-a-thon is done. Keep rockin' and keep shakin'. Smash Mouth out!</div>
