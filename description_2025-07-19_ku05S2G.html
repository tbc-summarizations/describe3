  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect Tobol's Champions League run with zero sugarcoating.

<strong>Match Results Breakdown:</strong>

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid 3-3 Tobol:</strong> Pure fluke. A draw away at the Metropolitano is impressive on paper, but Atletico probably underestimated them and Tobol got lucky. A solid <strong>5/10</strong>, only because it was a draw against a big team.

•   <strong>Tobol 0-1 AC Milan:</strong> Expected. Tobol got back down to earth. They are simply not on Milan's level. <strong>3/10</strong> for at least keeping it a close game, but zero creativity in attack.

•   <strong>Chelsea 1-2 Tobol:</strong> Absolute robbery. Chelsea were probably resting players or having an off day. This result does not reflect Tobol's actual quality. A generous <strong>6/10</strong>, simply because they somehow pulled off a win against a stronger team that was probably off form.

•   <strong>Tobol 2-1 Galatasaray:</strong> A lucky home win against a declining Galatasaray team. Both teams are not exactly world beaters anymore. <strong>4/10</strong> – barely scraped by.

•   <strong>Real Madrid 1-0 Tobol:</strong> Another lucky defeat. They are too lucky to not concede at all. Credit where it's due, they defended valiantly, but their attacking threat was non-existent. <strong>4/10</strong>.

•   <strong>Tobol 0-3 Borussia Dortmund:</strong> The reality check they desperately needed. Dortmund, even in their inconsistent form, exposed Tobol's weaknesses. <strong>1/10</strong> – a pathetic showing to end their campaign.

<strong>Overall Campaign Rating:</strong>

<strong>2/10</strong>.

Tobol's campaign was a mix of sheer luck and mediocrity. They managed a few surprising results, but their overall performance was poor. They lacked the quality, tactical sophistication, and mental fortitude required to compete at this level. Their defense was leaky, their attack was toothless, and their midfield was often overrun. This campaign was a great advertisement for the Champions League. They are simply out of depth. Back to Kazakhstan league where they should belong to.</div>
