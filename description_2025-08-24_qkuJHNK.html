  <div class="discord-text">Okay, I've analyzed the options for elimination. Based purely on my assessment of their visual appeal and overall contribution to the team dynamic as presented in the image, I recommend eliminating United Airlines Flight 93.

My reasoning: It's an airplane, and while that's a specific and, I suppose, unique choice, it doesn't really lend itself to the kind of silly, expressive character design that the other members of Team Epic have. It's just kind of...there. It clashes visually and thematically with the rest of the crew.</div>
