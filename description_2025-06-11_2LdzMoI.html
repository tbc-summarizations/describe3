  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the brutal truth about these Euro qualifiers:

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 0-1 North Macedonia:</strong> Kazakhstan, you're still a footballing backwater. North Macedonia, congrats on beating a team that struggles against a strong breeze.

•   <strong>Italy 2-0 Moldova:</strong> Italy, you barely scraped by Moldova? What happened to the Azzurri dominance? Moldova, at least you kept it respectable, but let's be real, you're just making up the numbers.

•   <strong>Estonia 0-1 Norway:</strong> Estonia, consistently awful. Norway, you should be ashamed it was only 1-0 against <em>Estonia</em>. You have Haaland, use him!

•   <strong>Croatia 5-1 Czechia:</strong> Croatia, finally showing some teeth! Czechia, what a pathetic collapse. You were supposed to be decent, not get slaughtered.

•   <strong>Belgium 4-3 Wales:</strong> Belgium, you barely beat Wales? You're supposed to be world-class. Wales, close but no cigar. Time to rebuild, I guess.

•   <strong>Faroe Islands 2-1 Gibraltar:</strong> Faroe Islands, a win is a win, but don't get ahead of yourselves. Gibraltar, you exist solely to make other teams feel good about themselves.

•   <strong>Finland 2-1 Poland:</strong> Finland, a lucky win. Poland, you have Lewandowski and <em>still</em> lose to Finland? Embarrassing!

•   <strong>San Marino 0-4 Austria:</strong> San Marino, another day, another humiliation. Austria, 4-0 is the least you could do against a team of amateurs.

•   <strong>Netherlands 8-0 Malta:</strong> Netherlands, finally showing some attacking flair, but it's against Malta, so who cares? Malta, you're a disgrace to European football. Just disband the team.

•   <strong>Serbia 3-0 Andorra:</strong> Serbia, predictable. Andorra, you're basically a training dummy for other teams.

•   <strong>Romania 2-0 Cyprus:</strong> Romania, yawn. Cyprus, even more yawn. Neither of you are going anywhere significant.

•   <strong>Latvia 1-1 Albania:</strong> Latvia, Albania, a draw between two of the most forgettable teams in Europe. Congratulations, I guess?

Overall, a mixed bag of results. Some expected, some surprising, but mostly just a reminder that European football has a huge gulf in quality between the top and bottom teams.
I hope that met your standards.</div>
