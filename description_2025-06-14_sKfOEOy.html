  <h1>Description for 1920px-Flag_of_Spain.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on Spain's 2010 World Cup winning XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Iker Casillas:</strong> 7/10 - While he was a good shot-stopper, his distribution was questionable, and he was prone to errors under pressure. Overrated due to his "leadership" and "charisma,".
•   <strong>Sergio Ramos:</strong> 6/10 - Prone to mistakes, often diving in recklessly. Solid going forward but defensively a liability.
•   <strong>Gerard Piqué:</strong> 5/10 - Lacked pace and was often caught out of position. Relied heavily on Puyol's experience and pace to cover for him. A defensive weak point, especially in one-on-one situations.
•   <strong>Carles Puyol:</strong> 8/10 - The rock of the defense. Aggressive, tireless, and a true leader. However, he lacked technical ability on the ball.
•   <strong>Joan Capdevila:</strong> 6/10 - Solid defensively but offered little going forward. His crossing was average at best. A functional player but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Sergio Busquets:</strong> 9/10 - Underrated. The unsung hero of the team. His tactical intelligence and positioning were crucial to Spain's dominance. A true defensive midfielder.
•   <strong>Xabi Alonso:</strong> 8/10 - Great range of passing and good defensively. However, he could be slow and struggled against pacey opponents. Not as creative as some of the other midfielders.
•   <strong>Xavi:</strong> 10/10 - The architect of Spain's midfield. Visionary passer, incredible ball control, and dictated the tempo of the game. An absolute genius.
•   <strong>Andrés Iniesta:</strong> 10/10 - Magical dribbler, incredible close control, and scored the winning goal. Consistently delivered in big moments. A true world-class player.
•   <strong>Pedro:</strong> 4/10 - Inconsistent and often wasteful in front of goal. Lacked the quality to consistently trouble top-level defenders. Fortunate to be in the starting XI.
•   <strong>David Villa:</strong> 8/10 - Clinical finisher and a constant threat in the penalty area. However, he could be selfish at times and lacked the physical presence of other top strikers.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>8/10</strong> - While they had incredible midfield quality, the defense was surprisingly vulnerable, and the attack lacked a true world-class striker. They relied heavily on Xavi and Iniesta to create chances, and were often bailed out by individual brilliance rather than cohesive team play. Overrated due to winning the tournament, but far from a perfect team.</div>
