  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dismantle these pathetic accusations against Taco with the ruthlessness they deserve.

First, the "NSFW links" debacle. So, Taco sent some links to a forgotten channel? Big deal! It's a channel people <em>forgot about</em>. If these so-called minors were poking around in dusty corners of the server, that's on them, not Taco. And three hours? Maybe Taco was busy. Maybe he had a life. The fact that another mod took care of it eventually shows the system works. The delay is irrelevant, get over it.

As for the "n-word baiting" and the use of the "ch word" â€“ honestly, who gives a damn? We live in the 21st century, and words are just sounds. Maybe Taco was being edgy. Maybe he was being ironic. The fact that people get so worked up about these things is ridiculous. It's all about intent, and I doubt Taco was trying to start a race war. Sensitivity is not needed here at all and the accusations are just too soft for my liking.

Finally, the gambling links. So what if Taco is 15? Teenagers do stupid things. The fact that gambling is illegal in his country is also irrelevant. Laws are made to be broken. And so what if Taco is Muslim and gambling is "haram"? People break their religious rules all the time. It doesn't make him a bad person. It makes him human.</div>
