  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest prediction for the Denmark vs. Greece 2026 World Cup qualifier, assuming a neutral stadium and the lineups you provided:

<strong>Score Prediction: Denmark 3 - 1 Greece</strong>

<strong>Justification:</strong>

•   <strong>Denmark's Superior Attack:</strong> Denmark's attacking trio of Bruun Larsen, Højlund, and Skov Olsen is simply more dynamic and clinical than Greece's. Højlund, in particular, is a proven goalscorer at a high level, and he will be a nightmare for the Greek central defenders. Bruun Larsen's pace and Skov Olsen's trickery will also stretch the Greek defense, creating opportunities.

•   <strong>Midfield Dominance:</strong> The Danish midfield, anchored by Hjulmand and O'Riley, will control the tempo of the game. They are both technically gifted and physically strong, and they will win the midfield battle against Mouzakitis, Karetsas, and Konstantelias. This control will allow Denmark to dictate play and create chances.

•   <strong>Defensive Solidity:</strong> While the Greek defense has some talented individuals, their overall cohesion is lacking. Christensen and Andersen are a solid central defensive partnership, and they will be able to contain the Greek attack, which lacks creativity. The fullbacks, Dorgu and Kristensen, are both solid defensively and offer good attacking support.

•   <strong>Greece's Weaknesses:</strong> Greece's attack is too reliant on individual brilliance and lacks a clear tactical plan. Their midfield is also too inexperienced and lacks the physicality to compete with Denmark's. The Greek defense is prone to errors, especially under pressure. Tzolakis in goal hasn't convinced at club level.

•   <strong>Individual Matchups:</strong> Højlund will dominate Mavropanos and Koulierakis physically and in the air. Damsgaard will cause problems for Vagiannidis with his dribbling and trickery. The Danish midfield will overwhelm the Greek midfield in terms of possession and control.

•   <strong>Neutral Venue Advantage:</strong> A neutral venue eliminates any home advantage for either team, further tilting the balance in favor of Denmark, who are the stronger team on paper.

<strong>Potential Scenarios:</strong>

•   <strong>Denmark Early Goal:</strong> If Denmark scores early, it could open the floodgates and lead to a more convincing victory.
•   <strong>Greece Parking the Bus:</strong> If Greece sits deep and defends in numbers, it could frustrate Denmark and make it a more difficult game. However, Denmark has the quality to break down even the most stubborn defenses.
•   <strong>Red Card:</strong> A red card to a key player on either team could significantly alter the course of the game.

<strong>In conclusion,</strong> Denmark is the stronger team with a more balanced squad and better individual players. Greece will struggle to contain their attack and will likely be outplayed in midfield. A 3-1 victory for Denmark is a realistic and probable outcome.</div>
