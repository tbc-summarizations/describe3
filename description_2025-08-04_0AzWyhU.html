  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here’s my no-holds-barred assessment of each club’s placement in this tier list, rated out of 10, with 1 being atrocious and 10 being spot on.

<strong>S Tier</strong>

•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> 7/10. Overrated due to recent form, but undeniably a powerhouse.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> 9/10. Consistently dominant, belongs near the top.
•   <strong>Panathinaikos:</strong> 2/10. Don't deserve that kind of placement, should be lower.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> 6/10. Bit high given the circumstances, but respect for their resilience.
•   <strong>Zenit:</strong> 5/10. Overrated due to domestic dominance in a weak league.
•   <strong>Rangers:</strong> 7/10. Respectable, but perhaps slightly inflated by history.

<strong>A Tier</strong>

•   <strong>Viktoria Plzeň:</strong> 5/10. Decent side, maybe a bit high.
•   <strong>Astana:</strong> 3/10. Overrated, should be in the B or C tier.
•   <strong>Aston Villa:</strong> 7/10. Deserves a good spot, might be rated a little high.
•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund:</strong> 8/10. A solid placement, consistently a top team.
•   <strong>Hamburg:</strong> 6/10. A decent club, but does not deserve A tier.
•   <strong>PAOK:</strong> 5/10. A little high given their inconsistency.
•   <strong>Chelsea:</strong> 6/10. Inconsistent.
•   <strong>West Ham:</strong> 7/10. Did very well recently, solid placement.
•   <strong>Lyon:</strong> 7/10. Fair placement, decent team.
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> 8/10. Good team but not S Tier.
•   <strong>Napoli:</strong> 9/10. Great placement.
•   <strong>Roma:</strong> 7/10. Good team, not A Tier good.
•   <strong>AZ Alkmaar:</strong> 7/10.
•   <strong>LOSC Lille:</strong> 7/10. Decent team.
•   <strong>Benfica:</strong> 8/10. Consistently strong, deserves to be here.
•   <strong>Sporting CP:</strong> 7/10. Can be great, can be inconsistent.
•   <strong>Rubin Kazan:</strong> 3/10. Should be way lower.

<strong>B Tier</strong>

•   <strong>Brentford:</strong> 7/10. Overrated, only there due to form.
•   <strong>Brighton:</strong> 7/10. Very similar to Brentford.
•   <strong>Genk:</strong> 6/10. Don't deserve B tier.
•   <strong>Everton:</strong> 5/10. Not great.
•   <strong>FC Nantes:</strong> 5/10. Should be C Tier.
•   <strong>ASSE:</strong> 4/10. Should be lower.

•   <strong>Torino:</strong> 7/10. They are decent.
•   <strong>Feyenoord:</strong> 6/10. They're great, maybe A tier.
•   <strong>Union Berlin:</strong> 7/10. They are good, maybe A Tier.
