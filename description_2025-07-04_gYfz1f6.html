  <h1>Description for top_10_fav_clubs.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the harsh truth about these clubs and their rivals:

•   <strong>Atyrau:</strong> Honestly, their rivals are probably just whoever is closest to them geographically in the Kazakhstan Premier League. They're not exactly a powerhouse attracting huge hate.
•   <strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong> Obvious answer: Real Madrid. El Derbi Madrileño. It's a class divide, a city-wide war. Also, increasingly, Barcelona due to title challenges.
•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> Manchester United. The "noisy neighbors" rivalry. United have history, City has oil money and recent dominance.
•   <strong>AC Milan:</strong> Inter Milan. The Derby della Madonnina. City rivals, massive implications for the Serie A title.
•   <strong>Besiktas:</strong> Galatasaray and Fenerbahce. This is a <em>nasty</em> rivalry spanning football, politics, and culture in Istanbul. It's one of the fiercest in the world.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> Borussia Dortmund. "Der Klassiker." The only team to challenge Bayern's dominance in recent years. Also, historically, 1860 Munich (local rivalry).
•   <strong>Qarabag:</strong> Zira FK and Neftchi Baku are main rivals in Azerbaijan Premier League
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> Dynamo Kyiv. A clash of ideologies, regions, and historical importance in Ukrainian football.
•   <strong>Zenit St. Petersburg:</strong> Spartak Moscow. A clash of the capitals, fueled by fan violence and title ambitions.
•   <strong>Rangers:</strong> Celtic. The "Old Firm". Far more than just a football rivalry; deeply rooted in religious and socio-political divisions. It's a powder keg.</div>
