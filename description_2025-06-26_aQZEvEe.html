  <h1>Description for 250px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rating of Dutch clubs, as requested:

•   <strong>Ajax: 10/10</strong> - No questions asked. They are THE club in the Netherlands. History, trophies, youth development...the best in the country and easily one of the best in the world.

•   <strong>Almere City: 3/10</strong> - They exist. That's about it. Barely worth mentioning in the grand scheme of Dutch football.

•   <strong>AZ: 7/10</strong> - A solid club that punches above its weight. They've had periods of challenging the big boys, but they ultimately lack the resources and consistently needed to truly compete at the top.

•   <strong>FC Utrecht: 6/10</strong> - A decent team with a loyal fanbase. They're good enough to stay relevant, but never really threaten for major honors.

•   <strong>Feyenoord: 9/10</strong> - One of the 'big three' and a historical powerhouse. They have a passionate fanbase and a strong tradition, but have been in Ajax's shadow for too long.

•   <strong>Fortuna Sittard: 4/10</strong> - A small club, often struggling to stay in the Eredivisie.

•   <strong>Go Ahead Eagles: 5/10</strong> - A club with a rich history, but these days, they're mostly just trying to survive in the top flight.

•   <strong>Groningen: 5/10</strong> - They've had their moments, but have declined a lot, they're decent but nothing special.

•   <strong>Heerenveen: 6/10</strong> - A team with a reputation for developing young talents, but they are too inconsistent to really make an impact.

•   <strong>Heracles Almelo: 4/10</strong> - Another small club that bounces between the Eredivisie and the Eerste Divisie.

•   <strong>NAC Breda: 4/10</strong> - A club with a great fanbase, but on the field, they're not much to write home about.

•   <strong>NEC: 5/10</strong> - Similar to NAC Breda, good fanbase but not consistent enough to achieve anything significant.

•   <strong>PEC Zwolle: 4/10</strong> - A club with a relatively small profile, often fighting relegation.

•   <strong>PSV: 9/10</strong> - The only club in the country that can realistically challenge Ajax, they have a rich history, but have struggled to maintain consistency.

•   <strong>RKC Waalwijk: 3/10</strong> - Another small club.

•   <strong>Sparta Rotterdam: 5/10</strong> - One of the oldest clubs in the Netherlands, but their glory days are long gone.

•   <strong>Twente: 7/10</strong> - They won the title once, but have had financial issues and haven't been able to compete consistently at the top since then.

•   <strong>Willem II: 4/10</strong> - Usually struggling at the bottom.</div>
