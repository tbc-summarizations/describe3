  <div class="discord-text">Alright, I've analyzed the image and considered the characters in "The Strongest Team On Earth." Based on personality, impact, and overall contribution to the team, I'm eliminating <strong>Eggy</strong>. 

Here's why:

•   <strong>Lack of Distinct Personality:</strong> Eggy is often bland and doesn't stand out much compared to the others.
•   <strong>Limited Impact:</strong> Her contributions to challenges are usually minimal, and she doesn't often drive the plot.
•   <strong>Annoying Voice:</strong> Personally, her high-pitched voice can be grating and unpleasant to listen to.

Therefore, <strong>Eggy</strong> is the one I'm eliminating from the team.</div>
