  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's construct a brutally honest and detailed starting XI using current players from Albania, Czech Republic, Poland, Moldova, and the Faroe Islands. I'm going with a 4-3-3 formation to maximize attacking potential, given the available talent (or lack thereof) from these nations.

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Wojciech Szczęsny (Poland):</strong> The only real choice here. Szczęsny is a top-class goalkeeper who currently plays for Juventus and is miles ahead of any other options from these countries.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>Right-Back: Vladimir Coufal (Czech Republic):</strong> A solid, no-nonsense defender. He has been playing in West Ham and consistently performs well, offering some attacking outlet.
•   <strong>Center-Back: Berat Djimsiti (Albania):</strong> Djimsiti provides a physical presence and decent organizational skills, essential for a team that will likely be under pressure in many games. He plays for Atalanta, and this is about as good as it gets in the Albanian defense.
•   <strong>Center-Back: Jakub Kiwior (Poland):</strong> Kiwior shows promise and plays for Arsenal. His inclusion is based on potential and the need for some quality in the backline.
•   <strong>Left-Back: Nicolae Milinceanu (Moldova):</strong> I mean, someone's gotta play there. Milinceanu is just a guy, playing for a club nobody has heard of.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Midfield: Kristjan Asllani (Albania):</strong> Asllani is a young player who currently plays for Inter Milan. He brings a certain level of composure and control.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Tomas Soucek (Czech Republic):</strong> Soucek is the engine of the midfield. His work rate is immense, and he is an aerial threat in both boxes. A must-have.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Piotr Zieliński (Poland):</strong> Zieliński is the creative force in this midfield. If he's on form, he can unlock defenses with his passing and dribbling.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Wing: Kamil Grosicki (Poland):</strong> The old man can still run a bit. Grosicki provides pace and experience on the wing. His inclusion speaks to the overall lack of quality in these teams.
•   <strong>Center Forward: Robert Lewandowski (Poland):</strong> Obviously the talisman and the only world-class player in this lineup. Lewandowski is still a goal-scoring machine. If this team scores, it'll be because of him.
•   <strong>Left Wing: Taulant Seferi (Albania):</strong> A young talent from Albania. He needs to prove a lot more before anyone calls him a reliable player.

<strong>Brutally Honest Assessment:</strong>

This team has a solid base with Szczęsny, Lewandowski, Soucek, and Zieliński, but it quickly falls off a cliff in terms of quality. The defense, outside of Kiwior and Djimsiti, is very average, and the full-backs are liabilities. The midfield needs Zieliński to be at his best to create anything, and the reliance on Lewandowski for goals is massive.

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Goalkeeping, goal-scoring (Lewandowski), and midfield work rate (Soucek).
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Defense, overall quality, lack of depth, and creative dependence on one player.

This team might be able to grind out a few results if everything clicks, but realistically, it would struggle against any of the top national teams. The Faroe Islands and Moldova players are simply not at the level required for competitive international football, and even the Albanian and Czech players are a mixed bag. Poland carries this team, but even they have their limitations.</div>
