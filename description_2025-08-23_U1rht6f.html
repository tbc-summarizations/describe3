  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on how these three would rank in a Battle for Dream Island competition:

•   <strong>3rd Place: Tennis Ball.</strong> He's smart and helpful, but he's also kind of a pushover. In a cutthroat competition, his niceness would be his downfall. He'd probably get manipulated or outsmarted by the others.

•   <strong>2nd Place: Snowball.</strong> He's got the aggression and the competitive spirit, which is necessary to make it far in the game. However, he's also got a temper and can be easily provoked. That impulsiveness would cost him in the end, leading to mistakes that hand the win to someone else.

•   <strong>1st Place: Evil Leafy.</strong> She's ruthless, cunning, and doesn't care who she hurts to get ahead. That's the perfect recipe for winning BFDI. She'd probably manipulate everyone, sabotage their efforts, and generally be a nightmare to deal with. But hey, winners don't need to be liked, they just need to win.</div>
