  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, hitting these albums with a Stone Age perspective, no holds barred:

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> Utterly alien. Sounds like the wind spirits are weeping in a frozen cave. I'd probably run from it in terror, thinking it was some kind of ice demon.

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust...:</strong> What in the hairy mammoth is this? Sounds like a dying creature trying to communicate with the cosmos. If it didn't scare me away, I'd probably try to replicate the strange noises with rocks and bones just to understand the primal force behind it.

•   <strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Lift Your Skinny Fists...:</strong> This is the sound of the Earth groaning, a slow, relentless doom. Perfect to soundtrack a volcanic eruption, but not exactly something I'd listen to around the campfire.

•   <strong>Have A Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> It conjures up the image of being alone in a blizzard with no fire. I would assume the creator of this album has made a deal with the devil.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> He's got the voice of an angel, or at least, a really charismatic bird. Maybe I'd try to learn some of his songs to woo a mate, but he's probably too soft for the harsh realities of survival.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> The rhythms are interesting, like the beat of tribal drums mixed with animal calls. I would assume this is some sort of warning.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> Messed up. It's like listening to the dreams of a god. I would avoid it at all costs.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> It sounds like a woman singing her heart out to the sun, moon and all the animals. I would start a religion about her.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> Sounds like the ravings of a mad shaman. If this music came from the forest, I would warn my tribe to avoid that area.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> This is the sound of my ancestors. The music feels as if it has been flowing through their veins for centuries.

•   <strong>Mingus - Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> This is the sound of total chaos. The horns are so loud that they are capable of awakening all the forest animals. I would throw this music into a fire.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> Some young punk is rapping about how he's the best hunter. I would give him a rock to the head.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> It would probably make me stare into the abyss until I died. 

•   <strong>Prince - Purple Rain:</strong> That guy's got so much testosterone it's dripping out his ears. He would attract all the girls with the voice and guitar skills.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> The sounds are coming from some alien dimension that humans aren't supposed to see.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> This dude probably has some crazy connection to the spirit world. I would be scared to listen to him, but the music feels very genuine.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> It sounds like I'm being invaded by demons. Whoever created this album deserves a fate of pain and suffering.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> Four guys playing a rock and roll album in my village. I would probably listen to them until I died and then keep listening to them as a ghost.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> The voice sounds almost like it is underwater. I would never trust someone who listens to this kind of music.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter the Wu-Tang:</strong> I would gather my tribe and attack whoever is making this music. This album makes me want to hunt.</div>
