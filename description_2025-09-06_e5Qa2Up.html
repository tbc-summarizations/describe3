  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's be brutally honest about this hypothetical 2026 World Cup qualifier: Armenia is getting demolished.

<strong>Predicted Scoreline: Armenia 0 - 5 Portugal</strong>

Here's why:

•   <strong>Goalkeeper Mismatch:</strong> Henri Avagyan plays for a domestic Armenian club and is a nobody. Diogo Costa, on the other hand, is a Champions League-level keeper. Expect Avagyan to be peppered with shots and make some glaring errors.

•   <strong>Defensive Disaster:</strong> Armenia's defense is a mess. Sergey Muradyan plays for Noah Yerevan in Armenia, Erik Piloyan is in Urartu and Georgiy Harutyunyan is in Puskas Akademia in the Hungarian League. They will get exposed time and time again by Portugal's speed and skill. Ruben Dias and Goncalo Inacio are world-class center-backs. They'll shut down anything Armenia tries. Even Joao Cancelo playing in the Saudi league is way better than the Armenian defense.

•   <strong>Midfield Domination:</strong> Eduard Spertsyan is decent, but Ugochukwu Iwu is in a mid table Russian league. Kamo Hovhannisyan plays in Armenia so the midfield is weak. Compare that to Vitinha, Joao Neves, and Bruno Fernandes, who are all playing for top European clubs. Portugal will control the midfield entirely. Armenia will struggle to string together any meaningful passes.

•   <strong>Attack Annihilation:</strong> Lucas Zelarayan is an Argentinian and Tigran Barseghyan is from Slovan Bratislava in Slovakia. They are alright players but wont do anything in the game. Portugal's attack is absolutely lethal. Cristiano Ronaldo, despite his age, is still a goal-scoring machine, and Joao Felix is in Saudi Arabia. Portugal's attack is far too powerful for Armenia to handle.

•   <strong>Tactical Superiority:</strong> Melikyan is nothing but a regular guy managing a small national team with zero international experience, while Roberto Martinez is a top-tier manager. Martinez will have Portugal perfectly organized and exploiting Armenia's weaknesses at every turn. The Armenian team will be disorganized and outmatched.

In conclusion, this match is a complete mismatch. Armenia simply doesn't have the quality to compete with Portugal. It will be a one-sided affair, with Portugal scoring at will and Armenia struggling to even get out of their own half. A 5-0 drubbing is a fair prediction.</div>
