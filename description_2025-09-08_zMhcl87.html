  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these quarter-final results with the brutal honesty they deserve:

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 6-1 Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> Italy just massacred Sweden, plain and simple. Sweden, you got absolutely demolished. Did you even show up to the match? Might as well have stayed home and watched paint dry, at least that would have been more exciting than your performance. Italy, congrats on the utter domination – now go win the whole damn thing.

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹 3-1 England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> Portugal sent England packing! England, what a disappointment. All that hype, all that talk, and you get outplayed by Portugal. Should of taken the match seriously! Portugal, well played! Go on and win it all.

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸 4-2 Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Spain took care of business against Norway. Norway, you put up a fight, but ultimately, you came short. Better luck next time, but honestly, don't expect much. Spain, solid win. Keep this momentum going.

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 3-2 Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> France barely squeezed by Serbia. Serbia, tough luck, but you almost pulled off the upset. France, you need to step it up. Can't be playing like this against good teams if you want to win.</div>
