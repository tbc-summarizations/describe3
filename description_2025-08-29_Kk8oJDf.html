  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this theoretical match and predict the score.

<strong>Kazakhstan National Team Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> A 4-2-4 formation can be very attacking, especially with players like Zainutdinov and Orazov in midfield providing a link. The attack has speed and hopefully youth.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> That defense looks suspect and slow, if they don't improve the team will have no success. Mukhammedzhan Seisen is also not good enough as a goalkeeper. I really have no idea why he plays for them he is so bad. The biggest weakness is a lack of international experience against cohesive teams, the defense isn't organized at all.

<strong>Astana Foreign XI Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Decent Midfield, and experienced foreign players who have probably played more competitive football then most of the Kazakhstan team. Josip Condric in goal is a very experienced player and solid.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Defense is not good enough and they will struggle against the Kazakhstan fast paced Attack. Foreign players might also not care as much as the national team players.

<strong>Score Prediction:</strong>

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both teams, I'm going with:

<strong>Kazakhstan National Team 3 - 2 Astana Foreign XI</strong>

•   <strong>Reasoning:</strong> I feel like the Kazakhstan National Team would win just because they play for pride and they care much more than the foreign players who may not be invested fully in the team. I also feel that the goalkeeper for Astana will concede a goal to the team just to show his teammates that he isn't a liability. It would be a competitive match, but the Kazakhstan team will prove too much for the foreigners to handle. The defensive capabilities on both sides are average, but I would say the Kazakhstan team's defense would be better due to them caring more.</div>
