  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of each club's chances of reaching the UEFA Conference League group stage, from the first qualifying round, based on their leagues' strength, recent European performance, and general squad quality:

•   <strong>Koper 🇸🇮</strong>: 5%. Slovenian football is improving, but still lags behind. Koper would need a very favorable draw.
•   <strong>Petrocub Hîncești 🇲🇩</strong>: 1%. Moldovan football is weak.
•   <strong>Malisheva 🇽🇰</strong>: 0.01%. Kosovo is a very weak footballing nation.
•   <strong>Ordabasy 🇰🇿</strong>: 3%. Kazakhstan has made some progress, but consistency is lacking. 
•   <strong>HJK Helsinki 🇫🇮</strong>: 30%. HJK is Finland's strongest club and has some European pedigree, but the Conference League is still a significant challenge.
•   <strong>SJK Seinäjoki 🇫🇮</strong>: 2%. Finnish sides outside HJK struggle in Europe.
•   <strong>St Patrick's Athletic 🇮🇪</strong>: 10%. Irish clubs can be tricky, but consistent progress is tough.
•   <strong>Urartu 🇦🇲</strong>: 1%. Armenian teams have some financial backing, but lack the quality on the field.
•   <strong>Pyunik 🇦🇲</strong>: 5%. Their occasional good runs are more luck than consistent quality.
•   <strong>Auda 🇱🇻</strong>: 0.5%. Latvian football is in a terrible state.
•   <strong>Daugavplis 🇱🇻</strong>: 0.1%.
•   <strong>KÍ Klaksvík 🇫🇴</strong>: 5%. Faroese football is on the up, but lacks the depth.
•   <strong>NSÍ Runavík 🇫🇴</strong>: 0.01%.
•   <strong>Borac Banja Luka 🇧🇦</strong>: 2%. Bosnian football is unstable, Borac is not a top side.
•   <strong>Željezničar 🇧🇦</strong>: 3%. Slightly more established than Borac, but faces the same problems.
•   <strong>Víkingur Reykjavík 🇮🇸</strong>: 3%. Icelandic teams can be competitive.
•   <strong>Valur 🇮🇸</strong>: 4%. Valur are usually stronger in Iceland.
•   <strong>Larne 🇬🇧 (Northern Ireland)</strong>: 8%. Northern Irish football is improving, but it's still a massive uphill battle.
•   <strong>Cliftonville 🇬🇧 (Northern Ireland)</strong>: 1%.
•   <strong>F91 Dudelange 🇱🇺</strong>: 10%. Luxembourg's best club has some European experience and can cause upsets.
•   <strong>Racing Union 🇱🇺</strong>: 0.1%.
•   <strong>Hegelmann 🇱🇹</strong>: 0.01%. Lithuanian football is weak.
•   <strong>Kauno Žalgiris 🇱🇹</strong>: 0.5%.
•   <strong>Birkirkara 🇲🇹</strong>: 0.1%. Maltese football is not competitive.
•   <strong>Floriana 🇲🇹</strong>: 0.1%.
•   <strong>Torpedo Kutaisi 🇬🇪</strong>: 3%. Georgian football is making strides, but Torpedo isn't the strongest.
•   <strong>Dila Gori 🇬🇪</strong>: 3%. Same as above.
•   <strong>Vllaznia 🇦🇱</strong>: 0.5%. Albanian football is very poor.
•   <strong>Partizani 🇦🇱</strong>: 1%. Slightly stronger, but still very unlikely.
•   <strong>Nõmme Kalju 🇪🇪</strong>: 2%. Estonian football is weak, Kalju is not the best.
•   <strong>Paide Linnameeskond 🇪🇪</strong>: 2%.
•   <strong>Flora Tallinn 🇪🇪</strong>: 5%.
•   <strong>Neman Grodno 🇧🇾</strong>: 0.1%. Belarusian football is struggling.
•   <strong>Torpedo-BelAZ Zhodino 🇧🇾</strong>: 0.1%.
•   <strong>Dynamo Brest 🇧🇾</strong>: 0.1%.
•   <strong>Vardar 🇲🇰</strong>: 0.01%. North Macedonian football is poor and in turmoil.
•   <strong>Sileks 🇲🇰</strong>: 0.01%.
•   <strong>Rabotnički 🇲🇰</strong>: 0.01%.
•   <strong>Atlètic Club d'Escaldes 🇦🇩</strong>: 0.0001%. Andorran football is incredibly weak.
•   <strong>FC Santa Coloma 🇦🇩</strong>: 0.0001%.
•   <strong>Penybont 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿</strong>: 0.001%. Welsh football is improving, but the gap is huge.
•   <strong>Haverfordwest County 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿</strong>: 0.001%.
•   <strong>Dečić 🇲🇪</strong>: 0.01%. Montenegrin football is not competitive.
•   <strong>Sutjeska 🇲🇪</strong>: 0.01%.
•   <strong>Bruno's Magpies 🇬🇮</strong>: 0.0001%. Gibraltarian football is incredibly weak.
•   <strong>St Joseph's 🇬🇮</strong>: 0.0001%.
•   <strong>La Fiorita 🇸🇲</strong>: 0.000001%. San Marino's clubs are essentially amateur.
•   <strong>Tre Fiori 🇸🇲</strong>: 0.000001%.

Keep in mind that even these low percentages are heavily influenced by the luck of the draw in each round. An easier path significantly improves their chances. Also, financial problems or squad issues can dramatically alter a club's prospects.</div>
