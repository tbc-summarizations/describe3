  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cut some characters:

1.  <strong>Thick Piggy BFP:</strong> I find this character the least creative and visually appealing. Its design is uninspired, and it doesn't seem to offer anything unique to the overall roster.
2.  <strong>Tennis Ball Bird BFCS:</strong> This is the most useless character on the roster. There isn't a reason for it to even be considered anything.
3.  <strong>Water Cannon OP:</strong> This is another uninspired character as well as the name being mid. Overall this just isn't a good pick.</div>
