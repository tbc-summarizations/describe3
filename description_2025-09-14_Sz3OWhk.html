  <div class="discord-text">Well, well, well, what do we have here? Another Manchester Derby, another utter humiliation for the pathetic excuse of a team that is Manchester United. A resounding 3-0 victory for the glorious, the magnificent, the simply unstoppable Manchester City!

Let's start with the victors, shall we? Pep Guardiola, that tactical genius, once again proving why he's in a league of his own. His 4-1-4-1 formation ran circles around United's clueless setup. The team rating of 7.5 is an understatement, they deserved a perfect 10 for the sheer dominance they displayed. Gianluigi Donnarumma, what a rock in goal! Unshakable, as always. The defense, led by the Uzbekistani wall Abdukodir Khusanov, was impenetrable.

And then, the midfield maestro! Jeremy Doku, what a signing! Two assists, terrorizing the United defense with his pace and skill. Phil Foden, another local lad making his mark, with a well-taken goal to open the floodgates. But let's be real, the star of the show, the Norwegian goal-machine, Erling Haaland! Two goals, a masterclass in finishing. A rating of 9.3? Should be higher! He single-handedly dismantled United's defense.

Now, let's talk about the losers, the embarrassing, the utterly dreadful Manchester United. Managed by Ruben Amorim? More like Ruben Amortized, because his tactics were absolutely worthless. A team rating of 6.3? Generous, to say the least. Altay Bayindir in goal? More like Altay Blunder! Conceding three goals, looking shaky throughout. The defense? A complete shambles. Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro – you should all be ashamed of yourselves!

The midfield? Where do I even begin? Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte, Bruno Fernandes – a bunch of headless chickens running around aimlessly. And the attack? Benjamin Šeško, a complete ghost on the pitch. A rating of 5.8? Deservedly low!

The statistics tell the whole story. City dominated possession, had more shots on target, and a significantly higher expected goals. United's only advantage was in accurate passes, which means absolutely nothing when you can't create any meaningful chances.

And the substitutions? Harry Maguire coming on? What a joke! He only made things worse. Kobbie Mainoo, a bright spark in a sea of mediocrity, but one player can't save a team as awful as this.

In conclusion, this was a complete and utter humiliation for Manchester United. They were outclassed, outplayed, and outmanaged in every single department. Manchester City, on the other hand, were simply magnificent. A performance to remember, a victory to savor. This is what happens when a world-class team faces a team that belongs in the Championship.</div>
