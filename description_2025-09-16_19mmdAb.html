  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this "Most Valuable XI" with brutal honesty:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>David Raya (Arsenal):</strong> 6/10. He's a decent shot-stopper, but prone to brain farts and doesn't command his area well enough for a top-tier Champions League team. His distribution is overrated.

•   <strong>Nuno Mendes (PSG):</strong> 7/10. He's got pace and can whip in a good cross, but his defensive positioning is questionable. He needs to mature his game significantly.

•   <strong>Alessandro Bastoni (Inter Milan):</strong> 8/10. One of the better ball-playing center-backs around. Reads the game well and isn't afraid to put in a tackle. Solid.

•   <strong>William Saliba (Arsenal):</strong> 8.5/10. Calm, composed, and dominant in the air. He's got the potential to be world-class. Only needs to improve his consistency.

•   <strong>Achraf Hakimi (PSG):</strong> 7.5/10. Electric going forward, but a defensive liability at times. Relies too much on his pace to recover.

•   <strong>Pedri (Barcelona):</strong> 7/10. When he's on, he's silky smooth, but he disappears in too many big games. Needs to add more bite to his game.

•   <strong>Federico Valverde (Real Madrid):</strong> 8/10. A workhorse with a great engine and a decent shot. He's the kind of player every manager loves, but not exactly a game-changer.

•   <strong>Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid):</strong> 9/10. Electric pace, incredible dribbling ability, and now adding goals to his game. He's a nightmare for defenders.

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid):</strong> 9.5/10. A complete midfielder with a ridiculous work rate, goal-scoring ability, and leadership qualities. A future Ballon d'Or winner.

•   <strong>Lamine Yamal (Barcelona):</strong> 7.5/10. Bags of potential and is very creative.

•   <strong>Kylian Mbappe (Real Madrid):</strong> 10/10. One of the best players in the world, end of discussion. Pace, power, skill, and a killer instinct.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7/10</strong>

This team has some serious firepower in attack with Vinicius, Bellingham, and Mbappe. The midfield has a good mix of creativity and energy, but there are some glaring weaknesses in defense. Raya is a liability in goal, and the full-backs are inconsistent defensively. The team also lacks a true defensive midfielder to shield the back four. Overall, this team is exciting to watch, but they are more likely to implode under pressure than to win the Champions League.</div>
