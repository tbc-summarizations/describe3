  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of Kazakhstan's national team matches and overall performance, broken down as requested. No sugarcoating here.

<strong>Individual Match Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Friendly Matches:</strong>

•   Guinea-Bissau 0-3 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Beating a lower-ranked team convincingly is expected.
•   Kazakhstan 1-1 Estonia: 4/10. A draw against Estonia is a poor result, lacks ambition.
•   Haiti 0-2 Kazakhstan: 6/10. Another win against a weaker opponent, nothing special.
•   Malawi 1-3 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Decent win, but Malawi isn't a strong footballing nation.
•   Kazakhstan 3-0 Namibia: 7/10. Good result, but again, against a team they should beat.
•   <strong>UEFA Nations League B:</strong>

•   Kazakhstan 1-3 Czechia: 3/10. Home loss, outclassed.
•   Sweden 2-2 Kazakhstan: 6/10. A draw against Sweden is okay, but Sweden likely wasn't at their best.
•   Finland 2-0 Kazakhstan: 2/10. Clear defeat, shows a gap in quality.
•   Czechia 2-0 Kazakhstan: 2/10. Another loss to Czechia, confirms inferiority.
•   Kazakhstan 2-0 Sweden: 7/10. Good win, but consistency is lacking.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Finland: 7/10. Decent result, but may be more about Finland's struggles.
•   <strong>UEFA European Championship Qualifiers:</strong>

•   Netherlands 2-0 Kazakhstan: 3/10. Expected loss, but could have been more competitive.
•   Israel 0-0 Kazakhstan: 5/10. A draw away is acceptable, but not inspiring.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Slovakia: 6/10. A win is good, but Slovakia isn't a top team.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Georgia: 6/10. Another win, but these are the games they <em>should</em> be winning at home.
•   Serbia 0-0 Kazakhstan: 6/10. A draw away is decent, but more ambition needed.
•   Kazakhstan 0-3 Netherlands: 1/10. Humiliating home defeat, completely outplayed.
•   Kazakhstan 3-0 Israel: 8/10. Excellent win, shows potential, but needs consistency.
•   Slovakia 1-0 Kazakhstan: 4/10. Loss against a team they beat at home is disappointing.
•   Georgia 0-0 Kazakhstan: 5/10. Another draw, lacking the cutting edge to win.
•   Kazakhstan 2-0 Serbia: 8/10. Great win, but too late to salvage the campaign.
•   <strong>FIFA World Cup Qualifiers:</strong>

•   Northern Ireland 0-1 Kazakhstan: 7/10. Good away win.
•   Kazakhstan 2-0 Hungary: 7/10. Solid home win.
•   Spain 1-0 Kazakhstan: 3/10. Expected loss, but should aim for damage limitation.
•   Ireland 3-0 Kazakhstan: 1/10. Crushing defeat, shows a significant gulf in class.
•   Kazakhstan 3-1 Ukraine: 8/10. Impressive win.
•   Kazakhstan 1-0 Northern Ireland: 6/10. Okay win, but Northern Ireland aren't top tier.
•   Hungary 2-0 Kazakhstan: 2/10. Disappointing loss after beating them at home.
•   Kazakhstan 0-2 Spain: 2/10. Expected loss.
•   Kazakhstan 1-1 Ireland: 5/10. A draw isn't enough.
•   Ukraine 1-0 Kazakhstan: 4/10. Another loss on the road.

<strong>Competition Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Friendly Matches:</strong> 5/10. Wins against weak teams aren't impressive, drawing against Estonia is a joke. Friendlies are for experimenting and building a team, not just padding stats against easy opponents.
•   <strong>UEFA Nations League B:</strong> 4/10. Staying in League B is the bare minimum. Inconsistent performances, not competitive enough against the stronger teams.
•   <strong>UEFA European Championship Qualifiers:</strong> 5/10. Some good wins, but ultimately failed to qualify. Inconsistency and heavy defeats against top teams exposed limitations.
•   <strong>FIFA World Cup Qualifiers:</strong> 5/10. Similar to Euro qualifiers, some promising results, but ultimately fell short. Couldn't compete with the top teams in the group.

<strong>Overall Performance:</strong>

<strong>4/10</strong>.

Kazakhstan shows occasional flashes of brilliance and can beat weaker to mid-level teams, especially at home. However, they consistently fail against stronger opposition and lack the consistency and mental fortitude to compete for qualification in major tournaments. The team needs a significant injection of quality, tactical discipline, and a winning mentality to progress. Simply put, they're mediocre.</div>
