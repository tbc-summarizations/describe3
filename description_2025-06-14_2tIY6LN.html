  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest attempt at forming a decent football XI from those nations. Let's not kid ourselves; we're scraping the bottom of the barrel in a few positions, but I'll try to maximize the limited talent available.

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3 (Desperate for Goals)</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>
•   <strong>Arijanet Murić (Kosovo):</strong> Look, none of these countries have a world-class keeper. Murić is the best of a mediocre bunch. He's prone to errors but has athleticism.

•   <strong>Defense:</strong>
•   <strong>Right Back: Andi Hoti (Kosovo):</strong> Not a world-beater, but Kosovan and fills a slot in a weak team. He's not going to bomb forward with pace or deliver pinpoint crosses.
•   <strong>Center Back: Amir Rrahmani (Kosovo):</strong> The only player from these nations playing at a top club (Napoli) – a solid Serie A defender. He's the only consistently high-quality player in this squad.
•   <strong>Center Back: Enea Mihaj (Albania - Eligible for Kosovo):</strong> A better option than what Belarus or Andorra can provide.
•   <strong>Left Back: Cristian Ganea (Romania):</strong> Decent defensively, but nothing special. Expect limited attacking output.

•   <strong>Midfield:</strong>
•   <strong>Defensive Midfield: Granit Xhaka (Switzerland):</strong> By far the biggest name and the only reason this midfield has any bite. An experienced and aggressive player, a leader, and technically sound.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Florent Muslija (Kosovo):</strong> This team seriously lacks creativity, and Muslija can provide.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Marius Marin (Romania):</strong> A player who works hard but ultimately lacks the quality to consistently dictate play at a high level.

•   <strong>Attack:</strong>
•   <strong>Right Wing: Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland):</strong> Past his prime, but the only player who can produce a moment of magic from these nations.
•   <strong>Striker: Zeki Amdouni (Switzerland):</strong> A decent striker but inconsistent. He needs service, which this team will struggle to provide.
•   <strong>Left Wing: Renato Steffen (Switzerland):</strong> A winger who is hardworking and can occasionally score.

<strong>Manager:</strong>
I'd suggest someone who's good at damage control.

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

This team is average at best. They have experience in midfield with Xhaka, a solid defender in Rrahmani, and little spark in attack with Shaqiri. There is little depth, and any injuries to key players would be catastrophic.

They would struggle against any of the top-tier nations and would likely be battling for survival in any competitive tournament. Realistically, this team would be fighting to avoid embarrassment more than anything else. It's a shame to have to say it, but the talent pool is incredibly shallow. They'd be lucky to win a game.</div>
