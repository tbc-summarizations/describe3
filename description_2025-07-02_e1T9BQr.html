  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Azerbaijan.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of the Azerbaijan squad, based purely on the names and my general football knowledge:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Shakhruddin Magomedaliyev:</strong> 5/10 - A pretty standard name, could be decent.
•   <strong>Rza Jafarov:</strong> 3/10 - Name sounds incredibly generic and forgettable.
•   <strong>Mekhti Dzhenetov:</strong> 2/10 - Absolutely awful name.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Badavi Guseynov:</strong> 6/10 - Sounds like he could be a solid, uncompromising defender.
•   <strong>Behlul Mustafazade:</strong> 4/10 - Nothing special, sounds like a benchwarmer.
•   <strong>Elvin Cafarguliyev:</strong> 5/10 - Decent enough name for a fullback, maybe?
•   <strong>Abbas Huseynov:</strong> 3/10 - Very common name, probably not standout material.
•   <strong>Rahil Mammadov:</strong> 5/10 - Sounds okay, like he might have a bit of pace.
•   <strong>Amin Seydiyev:</strong> 4/10 - Unremarkable, probably nothing special.
•   <strong>Elvin Badalov:</strong> 2/10 - Very forgettable name, probably a liability.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Emin Mahmudov:</strong> 7/10 - Sounds like a potential playmaker, could have some flair.
•   <strong>Toral Bayramov:</strong> 4/10 - Uninspiring, probably a workhorse type.
•   <strong>Cosqun Diniyev:</strong> 3/10 - Awful name, probably clumsy and slow.
•   <strong>Aleksey Isayev:</strong> 5/10 - Could be a decent, reliable player in the middle.
•   <strong>Elvin Camalov:</strong> 3/10 - Another forgettable name, won't make a difference.
•   <strong>Anatoliy Nuriyev:</strong> 4/10 - Might have a bit of skill, but probably inconsistent.
•   <strong>Ozan Kokcu:</strong> 6/10 - Sounds like he could be a promising young talent.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ramil Sheydayev:</strong> 6/10 - Sounds like he might have a bit of a goalscoring threat.
•   <strong>Mahir Emreli:</strong> 7/10 - Sounds like a tricky winger with pace.
•   <strong>Renat Dadashov:</strong> 5/10 - Average, nothing to suggest he's a great finisher.
•   <strong>Musa Qurbanli:</strong> 4/10 - Uninspiring name, probably a backup striker.
•   <strong>Rustam Akhmedzade:</strong> 3/10 - Sounds like he lacks any real quality.
•   <strong>Nariman Akhundzade:</strong> 2/10 - Completely awful, couldn't be any worse.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

Taking all that into account, I'd give this Azerbaijan squad a <strong>4/10</strong>. A bunch of forgettable names, a few with potential, and some real stinkers. They're probably going to struggle to compete at any significant level.</div>
