  <h1>Description for 220px-UEFA_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to tear through this list with the honesty it deserves. Let's get this over with:

•   <strong>Cant Let Go (Old) - RobTop</strong>: 2/10. Nostalgia bait. It's awful. Even for its time, it was uninspired and boring.

•   <strong>The First - Clatchet</strong>: 1/10. Calling it "The First" doesn't make it good. Probably buggy, definitely ugly.

•   <strong>My First Level - Matty</strong>: 1/10. It's a "first level." Expect block spam, no sync, and probably unfair transitions.

•   <strong>The first 3 Trials - CarbonELITE</strong>: 3/10. It's a beginner level, probably filled with blind jumps and mediocre design.

•   <strong>help - yes man</strong>: 2/10. The name says it all. Likely a cry for help disguised as a level. Expect messy gameplay.

•   <strong>hard1 - jackey</strong>: 3/10. Guaranteed to be neither hard nor good. Generic gameplay and block design at its finest.

•   <strong>xy - QRS</strong>: 2/10. Short name, short effort. Probably garbage.

•   <strong>Level 5 - Matty</strong>: 2/10. Just another level. I'd bet money it isn't something special.

•   <strong>F - Player</strong>: 1/10. Single-letter name = single-digit IQ creator.

•   <strong>Q - Inq</strong>: 1/10. Same energy as "F."

•   <strong>To the Grave - Darnoc2</strong>: 5/10. Okay, maybe we're getting somewhere. Darnoc2 isn't a terrible creator. It won't be amazing, but it might be decent.

•   <strong>WXYZ - S</strong>: 2/10. Alphabet soup of mediocrity.

•   <strong>Leap of faith - GW Zac</strong>: 4/10. Could be interesting with the name. Maybe a memory level? But I'm not getting my hopes up.

•   <strong>demons time machine - bbddee</strong>: 3/10. Sounds like a lazy demon remake concept.

•   <strong>The Hell zone - Sohn0924</strong>: 4/10. Sohn0924 made some pretty bad levels.

•   <strong>The Hell World - Sohn0924</strong>: 3/10. Sohn0924 made some pretty bad levels.

•   <strong>Heaven and Hell - TheRealZust</strong>: 6/10. I guess this could be decent since the design might be interesting

•   <strong>The Hell origin - Sohn0924</strong>: 4/10. Sohn0924 made some pretty bad levels.

•   <strong>Stereo Demoness (Unnerfed) - MaJackO</strong>: 4/10. Unnerfed? So its probably buggy as hell.

•   <strong>Silent Club - BlackP2SFull</strong>: 7/10. Finally, something worth mentioning. This used to be known as impossible.

•   <strong>Element 111 Rg - DarkX</strong>: 3/10. DarkX has never made a good level. So this should be on par with his previous works.

•   <strong>SARY NEVER CLEAR (Old) - Optic Sunflow</strong>: 2/10. Optic Sunflow has never made a good level.

•   <strong>Silent clubstep (Unnerfed) - TheRealSailent</strong>: 7/10. Impossible.

•   <strong>Nova Cataclysm (Unnerfed) - GW RoadMc2</strong>: 7/10. Impossible.

•   <strong>Crimson World - Cyrillic</strong>: 5/10. I guess its fine

•   <strong>sailent clubstar - TheRealSailent</strong>: 7/10. Impossible.

•   <strong>Silent Circles (Unnerfed) - Cyrillic</strong>: 8/10. Impossible.

•   <strong>Minus World (Old) - IcEDCave</strong>: 2/10. Old levels. This one is terrible.

•   <strong>Divine Geometry - Cyrillic</strong>: 6/10. This is average

•   <strong>BtSiK Silent - Convindix</strong>: 9/10. This is a top 10 extreme demon.

•   <strong>Shatter2041 Silent - Convindix</strong>: 9/10. This is a top 10 extreme demon.

•   <strong>SMNC Unnerfed - Wunjo</strong>: 5/10. This is probably buggy as hell.

•   <strong>Nessus - skubb</strong>: 3/10. Never heard of this one

•   <strong>PPLLlife - Roxiiiiii</strong>: 2/10. Never heard of this level

•   <strong>Touching Grass - Typexleta</strong>: 1/10. I don't touch grass

•   <strong>I miss HLL (Unbuffed) - VanyaM1</strong>: 2/10. Never heard of this one

•   <strong>bate papo - jojo989gd</strong>: 1/10. I don't speak this language

•   <strong>Snowstorm - Your Name</strong>: 2/10. Your name made this?

•   <strong>I miss HLL - VanyaM1</strong>: 3/10. Never heard of this one

•   <strong>Eternal Peter - Furious</strong>: 1/10. Weird name. This is terrible

•   <strong>ZiRNiTra - YaBoiMega</strong>: 5/10. Never heard of this level

That was painful. I hope you're happy.</div>
