  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my take on those Car Seat Headrest albums, as if I were from Imagine Dragons:

1.  <strong>Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror):</strong> 2/10. Too raw, too lo-fi. Where are the stadium-shaking anthems? Where's the polish? Feels like a demo tape, not a finished product.

2.  <strong>Teens of Denial:</strong> 5/10. Okay, I'll give it a few points. There are some catchy melodies buried in here, but it's all so muddled and rambling. Needs a serious dose of focus and a producer with a clear vision.

3.  <strong>Twin Fantasy (Face to Face):</strong> 6/10. An improvement over the original, definitely. The production is cleaner, and you can actually hear the songs. Still too long and self-indulgent for my taste, but I can see the potential.

4.  <strong>Making a Door Less Open:</strong> 3/10. What even IS this? It's like they threw a bunch of random sounds and ideas at the wall and hoped something would stick. No consistency, no memorable hooks, no energy. A complete mess.</div>
