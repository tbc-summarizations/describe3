  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on your tier list:

<strong>Overall: 3/10</strong>

<strong>Major Issues:</strong>

•   <strong>Manchester United in D?</strong> Are you high? Even in their current state, they're not the absolute dregs of football. Massive disrespect.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich and Man City in S?</strong> You clearly have some modern bias going on. They're good, not gods.
•   <strong>Arsenal in C?</strong> Seriously? Have you even watched football recently? They're consistently performing well.
•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen in D?</strong> What is your reason to put them so low when they are currently 1st in Bundesliga?

<strong>Inconsistent Tiering:</strong>

•   The tiers feel pretty random. There's no rhyme or reason why some teams are grouped together.

<strong>Possible Bias:</strong>

•   The bottom tier smells of some personal vendetta. There's no way you objectively think that the teams you placed down there are absolute dogshit.

<strong>In conclusion:</strong> Your tier list is a chaotic mess. It's like you randomly threw logos at a board and called it a day. Work on your knowledge of current form and historical significance.</div>
