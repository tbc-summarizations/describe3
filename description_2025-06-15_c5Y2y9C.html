  <h1>Description for 800px-Royal_Belgian_FA_logo_2019.png, 1024px-Slovak_Football_Association_logo.png, 800px-Romania_national_football_team_logo.png, 800px-Logo_FC3A9dC3A9ration_Ukraine_Football_2016.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of these national teams based on their historical performance:

â€¢   <strong>Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª:</strong> 4 stars. Belgium has had periods of real brilliance, but the lack of a major trophy to show for it keeps them from being a true 5-star team. They've consistently been competitive, but haven't fully delivered on their potential.

â€¢   <strong>Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°:</strong> 2 stars. As an independent nation, Slovakia has had moments, but they haven't achieved significant sustained success. Their history is relatively short, and they haven't reached the heights of some other European teams.

â€¢   <strong>Romania ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´:</strong> 3 stars. Romania has a decent footballing history, but lacks consistency. They've had golden generations and memorable World Cup moments, but haven't maintained a consistently high level of performance over time.

â€¢   <strong>Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦:</strong> 2 stars. Ukraine, much like Slovakia, is a relatively new national team. They've had a few flashes of success, but overall their history is not filled with trophies or deep tournament runs.</div>
