  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest rating of Italy's 2006 World Cup winning starting XI:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Gianluigi Buffon:</strong> 9/10. A world-class goalkeeper at his peak. His shot-stopping was phenomenal and he was a commanding presence in the box. A true legend.

•   <strong>Gianluca Zambrotta:</strong> 7/10. Solid and dependable, but not spectacular. He did his job well defensively and offered some attacking threat, but not a standout performer.

•   <strong>Fabio Cannavaro:</strong> 10/10. An absolute rock at the back. His performances in that tournament were arguably the best of his career. Impeccable positioning, tackling, and leadership.

•   <strong>Marco Materazzi:</strong> 6/10. Controversial and prone to errors, but he stepped up when needed. His goal in the final was crucial, but overall, his performances were inconsistent.

•   <strong>Fabio Grosso:</strong> 7/10. Scored the winning penalty in the final and was solid defensively. However, he wasn't always the most convincing defensively.

•   <strong>Mauro Camoranesi:</strong> 6/10. Work rate was great, but lacked the quality of some of his teammates. Not the most creative player, but did his job.

•   <strong>Gennaro Gattuso:</strong> 8/10. The engine of the team. His relentless tackling and energy were vital in protecting the defense. A true warrior.

•   <strong>Andrea Pirlo:</strong> 9/10. The brains of the team. His vision, passing range, and set-piece ability were exceptional. Dictated the tempo of the game and was always a threat.

•   <strong>Simone Perrotta:</strong> 5/10. The weak link in the midfield. Did a job, but lacks flair and creativity.

•   <strong>Francesco Totti:</strong> 7/10. Scored some important goals, but not at his best. His creativity and passing were still good, but he wasn't as explosive as in his prime.

•   <strong>Luca Toni:</strong> 6/10. Led the line well and scored a couple of goals, but wasn't prolific. His hold-up play and aerial ability were useful, but not a world-beater.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>8/10.</strong> A well-organized and disciplined team with a strong defense and midfield. They lacked some flair and firepower up front, but their tactical nous and teamwork were exceptional. They were a worthy winner of the World Cup.</div>
