  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into this batch of records as if it's the prime of the 1980s. Forget what comes later; we're judging these albums based on what's hot and what's not <em>right now</em>. No looking into the future!

<strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> (3/10)
Honestly, what is this? It sounds like something you'd hear in an art gallery – cold, distant, and completely lacking in anything resembling a catchy hook. This weird electronic stuff might appeal to some, but it's pretentious garbage. Good luck dancing to this.

<strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> (9/10)
Okay, this is more like it! Bowie is a total space-age rock god. Ziggy Stardust is weird, but in a cool, theatrical way. Great guitar riffs, killer vocals, and the songs stick in your head. This album is pretty important and pretty cool.

<strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> (1/10)
Are you serious? Four sides of instrumental garbage that goes nowhere. Sounds like a bunch of noise, or something for hippies and nerds. Turn this off.

<strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> (1/10)
I can barely understand what's being said. It's depressing, and if this is the future of music, I'd rather listen to dead air. Don't have a nice life if this is playing. 

<strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> (6/10)
This guy has a hell of a voice, but the whole thing is just a little too melodramatic and sad. Some of the guitar work is pretty impressive, but the songs themselves lack the punch that real rock music needs.

<strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> (2/10)
So much hype and what's delivered is so little. There are some clever lyrics but overall, it's one long song that goes on and on.

<strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> (7/10)
This album is weird, atmospheric, and honestly pretty cool. The opening track is a classic, and the rest of the album has a dark, mystical feel. Definitely not for everyone, but you can get into it.

<strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> (8/10)
I respect Lauryn Hill and her talents but this isn't for me. There are a lot of good songs here, like Doo Wop, and overall she is talented.

<strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> (6/10)
I do have to say that these are some creative flows here. However, I don't know what the hell they are doing at some points.

<strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> (10/10)
This is an all-time great. Soulful, powerful, and the songs are timeless. The message is important, and the music is smooth as silk.

<strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> (4/10)
Avant-garde jazz? I am not for it. This is just the same thing going on for an hour.

<strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> (7/10)
This is a solid hip-hop record with some serious skills on display. The beats are hard, the lyrics are sharp, and the overall vibe is tough. It's a good snapshot of street life, but not my favorite thing to listen to.

<strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> (8/10)
Pink Floyd continues to deliver a beautiful album with the song "Wish You Were Here". It's the only song from Pink Floyd I like.

<strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> (10/10)
This album is everything. Prince is a genius – a total rock star with amazing songs, killer guitar skills, and pure charisma. "Purple Rain" is a masterpiece.

<strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> (4/10)
Depressing, and boring, and it just drags on. Can't wait for it to be over.

<strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> (10/10)
Stevie Wonder is a musical genius, and this album is proof. From soulful ballads to funky jams, it's got something for everyone. A feel-good masterpiece.

<strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> (2/10)
The singer is screaming at me, and they are just screaming about random things that don't make any sense.

<strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> (9/10)
Even though it's old, Abbey Road is still a classic. The Beatles know what they're doing, and it shows. Some of their best work.

<strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> (5/10)
There are a lot of instruments here, but nothing that I enjoy. It's kind of all over the place.

<strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> (8/10)
This is hardcore hip-hop. Raw, gritty, and with a unique style. The beats are simple but effective, and the rapping is intense. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's a definite game-changer.</div>
