  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Belgian squad with the brutal honesty you requested. I'm not pulling any punches here.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Thibaut Courtois:</strong> 9/10. When he's on form, he's one of the best in the world. No arguments. But his injury record is starting to be a serious concern.
•   <strong>Matz Sels:</strong> 5/10. Decent backup, nothing more. Won't win you any games, won't lose you many either. Just... there.
•   <strong>Maarten Vandevoordt:</strong> 6/10. Potential is there, but he's young and unproven on the big stage. More of a project than a reliable option right now.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Thomas Meunier:</strong> 5/10. Once a solid player, now looks past his prime. Offers little going forward and defensively is a liability.
•   <strong>Timothy Castagne:</strong> 6/10. Workmanlike and versatile, but lacks the quality to be a starter for a top team.
•   <strong>Wout Faes:</strong> 4/10. Prone to errors, clumsy in possession. Not good enough for international level.
•   <strong>Arthur Theate:</strong> 6/10. Solid and dependable, but lacks the dynamism to be a top defender.
•   <strong>Zeno Debast:</strong> 5/10. Young and inexperienced, likely to make mistakes under pressure.
•   <strong>Maxim De Cuyper:</strong> 4/10. Unproven at the highest level, a gamble selection.
•   <strong>Ameen Al-Dakhil:</strong> 4/10. Another unproven player. Seems like a desperation call-up.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Kevin De Bruyne:</strong> 10/10. The heart and soul of the team. World-class playmaker, a game-changer. But how much does he have left in the tank? That's the question.
•   <strong>Youri Tielemans:</strong> 6/10. Can be decent on his day, but inconsistent and often disappears in big games.
•   <strong>Hans Vanaken:</strong> 4/10. Slow, lacks athleticism, doesn't offer enough defensively. A liability against quicker opponents.
•   <strong>Orel Mangala:</strong> 6/10. A decent defensive midfielder, but lacks the creativity to contribute going forward.
•   <strong>Amadou Onana:</strong> 7/10. Promising young player with good physical attributes. Needs to develop his game further.
•   <strong>Charles De Ketelaere:</strong> 5/10. Massively underperforming since his move to Milan. Needs to rediscover his confidence and form.
•   <strong>Alexis Saelemaekers:</strong> 5/10. Energetic and hardworking, but lacks the quality to be a consistent starter.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Romelu Lukaku:</strong> 7/10. Still a decent goalscorer, but his first touch is atrocious and he slows down attacks.
•   <strong>Michy Batshuayi:</strong> 5/10. A decent backup striker, but lacks the quality to be a regular starter.
•   <strong>Leandro Trossard:</strong> 7/10. A dangerous player with an eye for goal. Can be a match-winner on his day.
•   <strong>Jeremy Doku:</strong> 8/10. Explosive winger with incredible dribbling skills. A nightmare for defenders.
•   <strong>Lois Openda:</strong> 7/10. Quick and clinical finisher. A promising young talent.
•   <strong>Dodi Lukebakio:</strong> 5/10. Inconsistent and often frustrating to watch.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5/10</strong>

This Belgium squad is a shadow of its former self. The golden generation is fading, and the replacements simply aren't good enough. There's a lack of quality in defense and midfield, and too much reliance on De Bruyne and Lukaku. They might scrape through the group stages, but they'll be exposed against any top team. Expect disappointment.</div>
