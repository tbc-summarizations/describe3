  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's see what sort of racket this "music" is, shall we? I'll give you my unvarnished opinion, as any decent citizen of the 1800s would:

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> Utterly bizarre! Sounds like the ramblings of a fevered madwoman set to a bizarre collection of chimes and whistles. A disgrace to musical artistry.

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> An abomination! This "rock" music is an insult to proper instrumentation, and the lyrics are pure and utter degeneracy. This "Ziggy Stardust" is a deviant and pervert.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> What is this cacophony? It sounds like the machinery in the factories of the Industrial Revolution gone mad. A pointless exercise in noise.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> Depressing and morbid! Enough to drive a man to drink or worse. Music should uplift, not wallow in gloom.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> This wailing is hardly graceful! Overwrought and melodramatic. The singer needs to learn some restraint and good sense.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> A jumble of incoherent mumbling and vulgarity. The rhythmic elements are monotonous and the subject matter is clearly inappropriate for public consumption.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> A pretentious mess! These "progressive" rock bands are full of themselves. Give me a good march any day.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> While there may be some skill in the singing, the subject matter is too forward and frankly, impertinent for a woman. A woman should sing sweet melodies, not offer brazen opinions.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> A pointless stream of consciousness over a messy collection of nonsensical noises. Pure garbage.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> This music is far too suggestive! A scandalous piece of work with indecent undertones.

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> This "jazz" is chaotic and undisciplined! It lacks the structure and refinement of proper music. It sounds like a brawl in a saloon.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> Another stream of vulgarity that glorifies the gutter. This is the kind of music that will corrupt the youth and lead to moral decay.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> A dreamy and disjointed piece of work. Lacking in substance and proper musical form.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> Appalling! This "Prince" is clearly a dissolute. The music is overly sensual and the lyrics are suggestive. An affront to public decency.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> Depressing and devoid of joy. It is not the purpose of music to inspire despair, but to uplift the soul.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> There are some melodies here that are pleasing, but the overall style is too frivolous. Music should be substantial, not mere entertainment.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> Noise, pure and simple! This "heavy metal" is an assault on the ears and the mind. Utterly devoid of artistic merit.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> Overrated! These "Beatles" are merely a passing fad. Their music is simplistic and their popularity is baffling.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> More of this formless, navel-gazing nonsense. The lack of structure and melody is offensive to anyone with a discerning ear.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> Barbaric! This "rap" music is nothing but crude language and violent imagery. It is a menace to society.</div>
