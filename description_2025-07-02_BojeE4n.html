  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Austria.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of Austria's squad, player by player, and then a team rating:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Heinz Lindner:</strong> 4/10 - A journeyman keeper, reliable enough but not exactly inspiring confidence.
•   <strong>Alexander Schlager:</strong> 5/10 - Decent, but lacks the top-tier quality for a national team.
•   <strong>Patrick Pentz:</strong> 4/10 - Similar to Schlager, serviceable but not a game-changer.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>David Alaba:</strong> 8/10 - World-class when played in his best position, but his form has dipped somewhat. Still the star of the team.
•   <strong>Stefan Posch:</strong> 6/10 - Solid defender, nothing exceptional.
•   <strong>Stefan Lainer:</strong> 5/10 - A workhorse, but can be exposed defensively.
•   <strong>Philipp Lienhart:</strong> 6/10 - Dependable, but prone to occasional mistakes.
•   <strong>Maximilian Wober:</strong> 6/10 - Decent in the air, but not the quickest.
•   <strong>Kevin Danso:</strong> 6/10 - Physical, but sometimes rash in his challenges.
•   <strong>Phillipp Mwene:</strong> 5/10 - Versatile, but doesn't excel in any particular area.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Marcel Sabitzer:</strong> 7/10 - Has moments of brilliance, but inconsistent and can disappear in games.
•   <strong>Konrad Laimer:</strong> 7/10 - Energetic and good at winning the ball back, but limited creatively.
•   <strong>Florian Grillitsch:</strong> 6/10 - A tidy player, but lacks the spark to unlock defenses.
•   <strong>Xaver Schlager:</strong> 6/10 - Steady, but not particularly exciting.
•   <strong>Nicolas Seiwald:</strong> 5/10 - Promising, but still raw and unproven at the highest level.
•   <strong>Florian Kainz:</strong> 5/10 - Can deliver a good cross, but lacks pace.
•   <strong>Romano Schmid:</strong> 4/10 - Still young and inexperienced.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Christoph Baumgartner:</strong> 7/10 - A bright spark, but can be too individualistic.
•   <strong>Marko Arnautovic:</strong> 7/10 - Aging but still has moments of quality. A bit of a loose cannon.
•   <strong>Michael Gregoritsch:</strong> 6/10 - Decent target man, but not prolific.
•   <strong>Andreas Weimann:</strong> 5/10 - Veteran, but not the same player he once was.
•   <strong>Guido Burgstaller:</strong> 4/10 - Limited technically.
•   <strong>Junior Adamu:</strong> 5/10 - Raw and unproven.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5/10</strong>

This Austrian squad is largely average. They have a couple of standout players in Alaba and maybe Sabitzer on his day, but the overall quality and depth are lacking. They're unlikely to make a significant impact in any major tournament and are more likely to be an also-ran. They're just not good enough.</div>
