  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest rating of each of those clubs out of 10:

•   <strong>Atyrau 🇰🇿:</strong> 2/10. Let's be real, they're a team from Kazakhstan's top league. Not exactly a global powerhouse.
•   <strong>Auda 🇱🇻:</strong> 3/10. Decent in Latvia, but that's about it.
•   <strong>Breidablik 🇮🇸:</strong> 3/10. They dominate in Iceland, which is not exactly a top football nation.
•   <strong>Bursaspor 🇹🇷:</strong> 5/10. They had their moment, even winning the Turkish league once, but have fallen off a cliff.
•   <strong>Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 7/10. A big fish in a small pond. They're successful in Scotland, but struggle in Europe.
•   <strong>Cercle Brugge 🇧🇪:</strong> 4/10. A mid-table Belgian side. Not great, not terrible.
•   <strong>Egnatia 🇦🇱:</strong> 2/10. Barely anyone even knows this team.
•   <strong>Ferencvaros 🇭🇺:</strong> 5/10. The top team in Hungary, but Hungary is not a top-tier nation.
•   <strong>Flora Tallinn 🇪🇪:</strong> 2/10. Estonian football just isn't that strong.
•   <strong>Groningen 🇳🇱:</strong> 4/10. They bounce between the Eredivisie and the second tier in Netherlands.
•   <strong>Hammarby 🇸🇪:</strong> 5/10. A solid Swedish team with a passionate fanbase, but not elite.
•   <strong>Jablonec 🇨🇿:</strong> 4/10. A decent team in the Czech Republic, but nothing special.
•   <strong>Karpaty Lviv 🇺🇦:</strong> 3/10. Ukrainian football has been hit hard, and they were never a top team to begin with.
•   <strong>Krasnodar 🇷🇺:</strong> 6/10. They are a team with money and European ambitions but in Russia.
•   <strong>Legia Warsaw 🇵🇱:</strong> 5/10. The top team in Poland, but Polish football is not elite.
•   <strong>Ludogorets 🇧🇬:</strong> 4/10. Dominant in Bulgaria, but they struggle to make an impact in Europe.
•   <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana 🇸🇮:</strong> 3/10. Decent in Slovenia, but that's about it.
•   <strong>Omonia Nicosia 🇨🇾:</strong> 4/10. One of the better teams in Cyprus, but that's not saying much.
•   <strong>Panathinaikos 🇬🇷:</strong> 5/10. Once a major force in Greek football, but they've fallen on hard times.
•   <strong>Plymouth 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 3/10. League one level at best.
•   <strong>Rapid Wien 🇦🇹:</strong> 5/10. One of Austria's bigger clubs, but they haven't been relevant in a while.
•   <strong>Real Betis 🇪🇸:</strong> 7/10. They're fun to watch and can beat anyone on their day, but they lack consistency.
•   <strong>Saint-Etienne 🇫🇷:</strong> 6/10. A historic club that has fallen on hard times. A second division club.
•   <strong>Sassuolo 🇮🇹:</strong> 6/10. The team that will never be great.
•   <strong>Shamrock Rovers 🇮🇪:</strong> 4/10. Big in Ireland, but that's a small pond.
•   <strong>Sporting CP 🇵🇹:</strong> 7/10. A historic Portuguese club, but always in the shadow of Porto and Benfica.
•   <strong>St. Gallen 🇨🇭:</strong> 4/10. Mid-table Swiss team, nothing special.
•   <strong>The New Saints 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> 2/10. Welsh football is not good.
•   <strong>Viborg 🇩🇰:</strong> 4/10. A decent team in Denmark, but nothing special.
•   <strong>Werder Bremen 🇩🇪:</strong> 7/10. A big club that has been mismanaged in the past years.
•   <strong>Zalgiris 🇱🇹:</strong> 2/10. Another small club.
•   <strong>Zilina 🇸🇰:</strong> 3/10. Slovakian football isn't exactly world-beating.
•   <strong>Zimbru Chisinau 🇲🇩:</strong> 1/10. Even worse than welsh football.

That's my honest assessment. Take it or leave it.</div>
