  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of Kazakhstan's national team performance, as you requested:

<strong>Friendly Matches:</strong>

•   <strong>Kuwait 0-6 Kazakhstan:</strong> 9/10 - A dominant win against a weaker opponent. Great for confidence and goal difference.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 3-0 China:</strong> 7/10 - Solid victory against a team typically considered a peer. No complaints.
•   <strong>Gambia 1-3 Kazakhstan:</strong> 6/10 - A win against an African side, but conceding a goal raises questions about defensive solidity.
•   <strong>Uganda 1-2 Kazakhstan:</strong> 5/10 - Another narrow win against an African team, suggesting inconsistency and struggling to dominate.

<strong>Overall Friendly Performance:</strong> 6.75/10 - Decent results but the level of opposition wasn't top-tier. Areas for improvement in defensive organization.

<strong>UEFA Nations League B:</strong>

•   <strong>Poland 2-2 Kazakhstan:</strong> 7/10 - A valuable away draw against a strong opponent. Shows resilience.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 1-1 Wales:</strong> 5/10 - Disappointing home draw against a team they should be aiming to beat.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 1-0 Slovakia:</strong> 6/10 - A narrow win, but against a team of comparable quality. Shows potential.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 2-1 Poland:</strong> 8/10 - Impressive home win against Poland. A statement victory.
•   <strong>Wales 2-1 Kazakhstan:</strong> 4/10 - Losing away to Wales is a setback. Inconsistency is a major issue.
•   <strong>Slovakia 1-0 Kazakhstan:</strong> 3/10 - Losing to Slovakia away is a poor result. Lacking cutting edge.

<strong>Overall Nations League Performance:</strong> 5.5/10 - Mixed bag. Some good results against strong teams, but too many inconsistent performances. Staying in League B is mediocre.

<strong>UEFA European Championship Qualifiers:</strong>

•   <strong>Slovenia 1-1 Kazakhstan:</strong> 6/10 - Decent away point to start.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 1-0 Croatia:</strong> 9/10 - Massive, unexpected win against a top team.
•   <strong>Belgium 2-1 Kazakhstan:</strong> 4/10 - Expected loss, but a narrow defeat isn't terrible.
•   <strong>Georgia 2-0 Kazakhstan:</strong> 2/10 - Terrible result. No excuses.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 0-0 Bulgaria:</strong> 4/10 - Home draw against a weak team. Poor.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 1-0 Slovenia:</strong> 7/10 - Important home win to keep qualification hopes alive.
•   <strong>Croatia 0-1 Kazakhstan:</strong> 10/10 - Stunning away win against Croatia. Unbelievable.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 3-1 Belgium:</strong> 9/10 - Another huge shock. Shows incredible potential.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 2-1 Georgia:</strong> 7/10 - Vital win after the away defeat.
•   <strong>Bulgaria 0-1 Kazakhstan:</strong> 7/10 - Necessary win to secure qualification.

<strong>Overall Euro Qualifiers Performance:</strong> 8/10 - Exceeded all expectations. Qualified against the odds. Some truly incredible results.

<strong>UEFA European Championship:</strong>

•   <strong>Germany 1-2 Kazakhstan:</strong> 9/10 - Shocking win against the hosts.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 1-2 Russia:</strong> 4/10 - Disappointing loss to a rival.
•   <strong>Denmark 1-2 Kazakhstan:</strong> 7/10 - Vital win to secure qualification to the knockout stages.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 0(5)-(4)0 Hungary:</strong> 7/10 - Lucky to get through on penalties.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 1-2 Turkey:</strong> 5/10 - Respectable quarter-final exit.

<strong>Overall Euro Performance:</strong> 7/10 - A great run to the quarter-finals. Exceeded expectations but ultimately fell short.

<strong>FIFA World Cup Qualifiers:</strong>

•   <strong>Georgia 0-0 Kazakhstan:</strong> 5/10 - Uninspiring start.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 1-1 England:</strong> 7/10 - Good point against a top team.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 0-1 Albania:</strong> 3/10 - Home loss to a weaker team. Unacceptable.
•   <strong>Sweden 2-2 Kazakhstan:</strong> 6/10 - Decent away point.
•   <strong>Croatia 2-0 Kazakhstan:</strong> 3/10 - Expected loss, but a heavy defeat.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 3-0 Georgia:</strong> 7/10 - Good response after the away draw.
•   <strong>England 3-0 Kazakhstan:</strong> 2/10 - Crushing defeat. Exposed.
•   <strong>Albania 0-2 Kazakhstan:</strong> 7/10 - Good away win to keep hopes alive.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 2-1 Sweden:</strong> 8/10 - Impressive win against a strong side.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 0-0 Croatia:</strong> 5/10 - Not enough to qualify.

<strong>Overall World Cup Qualifiers Performance:</strong> 5/10 - Inconsistent. Some good results, but not enough to challenge for qualification.

<strong>Overall Performance (Out of 10):</strong>

Taking into account all competitions and matches, I'd give Kazakhstan's national team a <strong>6.35/10</strong>. They showed flashes of brilliance, particularly in the Euro qualifiers and the tournament itself, but overall consistency and struggling against weaker opposition let them down. There's potential, but they need to find a way to perform at a high level more regularly.</div>
