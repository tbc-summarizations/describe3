  <h1>Description for 1280px-Flag_of_Brazil.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here's my brutally honest assessment of Brazil's 2002 World Cup winning starting XI:

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: Marcos (6/10)</strong> - A solid shot-stopper, but not a world-class keeper in the traditional sense. Benefitted from a strong defense in front of him.

•   <strong>Defenders: Lúcio (8/10)</strong> - A beast. Strong, commanding, and surprisingly good on the ball for a big guy. One of the best center-backs of his generation.

•   <strong>Defenders: Edmílson (7/10)</strong> - Versatile and reliable. Not flashy, but did his job effectively, whether playing in defense or midfield.

•   <strong>Defenders: Roque Júnior (4/10)</strong> - The weak link in the defense. Prone to errors and a bit of a liability at times. How he started ahead of better options is beyond me.

•   <strong>Midfielders: Cafu (8/10)</strong> - An energetic and attacking fullback. Provided width and endless running. A true legend of Brazilian football.

•   <strong>Midfielders: Gilberto Silva (7/10)</strong> - The unsung hero. A defensive midfielder who shielded the back four and allowed the attacking players to shine. Underappreciated.

•   <strong>Midfielders: Kléberson (6/10)</strong> - A decent player, but not a standout. Had some good moments, but not consistently impactful.

•   <strong>Midfielders: Roberto Carlos (8/10)</strong> - A powerhouse of a fullback. Known for his thunderous shots and attacking prowess. Sometimes suspect defensively, but his attacking contributions made up for it.

•   <strong>Attackers: Ronaldinho (9/10)</strong> - Pure magic. An absolute joy to watch. Dribbling skills, creativity, and goal-scoring ability were off the charts. A key player in the team's success.

•   <strong>Attackers: Rivaldo (8/10)</strong> - A world-class player. Deadly in front of goal and capable of creating something out of nothing. A bit of a diver, but undeniably talented.

•   <strong>Attackers: Ronaldo (9/10)</strong> - The star of the show. Overcame serious injuries to lead the team to victory with his goals. A clinical finisher and one of the greatest strikers of all time.

<strong>Overall Team (8.5/10)</strong> - A very good team with a fantastic attacking trio. However, the defense had weaknesses, and the midfield, while solid, wasn't the most creative. They were fortunate to have Ronaldo in peak form, which made up for some of their shortcomings. They were clinical and ruthless, but not quite a perfect team.</div>
