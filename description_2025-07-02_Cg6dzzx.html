  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Armenia.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. This is going to be harsh, but you asked for it.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ognjen Cancarevic:</strong> 4/10. Decent shot-stopper, but prone to errors and lacks command of his area.
•   <strong>Arsen Beglaryan:</strong> 3/10. Not good enough for international level. Slow reactions and questionable decision-making.
•   <strong>Henri Avagyan:</strong> 2/10. Basically a training cone.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Varazdat Haroyan:</strong> 6/10. The only decent defender in the squad. Solid but not world-class.
•   <strong>Kamo Hovhannisyan:</strong> 4/10. Average at best. Lacks pace and is easily beaten by skillful wingers.
•   <strong>Hovhannes Hambardzumyan:</strong> 3/10. Over the hill. Too slow and often caught out of position.
•   <strong>Andre Calisir:</strong> 4/10. Prone to mistakes and lacks physicality.
•   <strong>Georgy Arutyunyan:</strong> 2/10. Not good enough for this level.
•   <strong>Nair Tiknizyan:</strong> 5/10. Shows some promise but needs to improve his defensive awareness.
•   <strong>Styopa Mkrtchyan:</strong> 3/10. Lacks the quality to make an impact at this level.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Eduard Spertsyan:</strong> 7/10. The only bright spark in midfield. Creative and technically gifted.
•   <strong>Lucas Zelarayan:</strong> 6/10. Good player, but inconsistent. Needs to be more impactful.
•   <strong>Vahan Bichakhchyan:</strong> 5/10. Energetic but lacks the quality to make a real difference.
•   <strong>Artak Dashyan:</strong> 4/10. Nothing special. A workmanlike player but lacks creativity.
•   <strong>Solomon Udo:</strong> 3/10. Overrated. Slow and lacks vision.
•   <strong>Edgar Sevikyan:</strong> 4/10. Shows some potential but needs to improve his decision-making.
•   <strong>Ugochukwu Iwu:</strong> 3/10. Anonymous on the pitch. Offers little in terms of creativity or defensive stability.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Tigran Barseghyan:</strong> 6/10. Can be dangerous on his day, but often lacks consistency.
•   <strong>Artur Serobyan:</strong> 4/10. Not good enough. Lacks pace and is easily marked out of the game.
•   <strong>Zhirayr Shaghoyan:</strong> 3/10. Overhyped. Fails to deliver on the big stage.
•   <strong>Grant-Leon Ranos:</strong> 5/10. Shows some potential but needs to improve his finishing.
•   <strong>Artur Miranyan:</strong> 3/10. Invisible. Offers nothing to the attack.
•   <strong>Arayik Eloyan:</strong> 2/10. Waste of space.

<strong>Overall Team:</strong>

<strong>3/10.</strong> This is a terrible squad. Lacking in quality in almost every position. The defense is a disaster, the midfield lacks creativity, and the attack is toothless. Only Spertsyan and maybe Zelarayan offer any real quality. They'll struggle to compete against any decent team. Expect a lot of defeats and very few goals.</div>
