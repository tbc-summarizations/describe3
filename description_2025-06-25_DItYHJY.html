  <h1>Description for green.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the brutal truth about all the clubs I see in the image, no sugarcoating:

•   <strong>Breiðablik:</strong> Some club from Iceland, probably freezing their asses off half the year.
•   <strong>Shamrock Rovers F.C.:</strong> Yet another Irish club trying to be relevant.
•   <strong>Celtic Football Club:</strong> These Glasgow guys aren't as good as their fans think.
•   <strong>P.A.F.C:</strong> Not great, not terrible.
•   <strong>FODSPORTS FOREN:</strong> Sounds like some Scandinavian club that no one cares about outside their town.
•   <strong>Jablonec:</strong> A Czech club that is completely uninteresting.
•   <strong>AS Saint-Étienne:</strong> These French guys are known to let their fans go loose.
•   <strong>FC St. Gallen:</strong> A Swiss club that is irrelevant
•   <strong>Rapid Wien:</strong> Always the bridesmaid, never the bride in Austria.
•   <strong>Ferencvárosi TC:</strong> These Hungarians live for glory of the past.
•   <strong>U.S. Sassuolo:</strong> This small Italian club have a good ownership so they are good for italian football.
•   <strong>FC Flora:</strong> Barely relevant even in Estonia.
•   <strong>FK Žalgiris Vilnius:</strong> Some Lithuanian club that isn't worth mentioning.
•   <strong>Legia Warsaw:</strong> Trash club.
•   <strong>FC Krasnodar:</strong> Owned by a Russian oligarch, enough said.
•   <strong>FC Atyrau:</strong> Another garbage club from Kazakhstan.
•   <strong>FK Karpaty Lviv:</strong> Ukrainian club that is constantly in crisis.
•   <strong>FC Zimbru Chișinău:</strong> This team from Moldova. How good could they possibly be?
•   <strong>Egnatia Rrogozhinë:</strong> Albanian team that is probably corrupt.
•   <strong>PFC Ludogorets Razgrad:</strong> Bulgarian club that is always buying refs.
•   <strong>Panathinaikos FC:</strong> Greek club that is just a shadow of its former self.
•   <strong>Bursaspor:</strong> One of the most irrelevant clubs in Turkey.
•   <strong>Sporting CP:</strong> A Portuguese club with fans that are too sensitive.
•   <strong>Real Betis:</strong> Bunch of overpaid players wasting their time in Spain.</div>
