  <div class="discord-text">Alright! Let's rank these Stevie Wonder albums like William Hung would:

•   <strong>The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie:</strong> 3/10 - Little Stevie, but jazz? Eh, I prefer to sing!
•   <strong>Tribute to Uncle Ray:</strong> 4/10 - Uncle Ray is cool, but I like my own style!
•   <strong>With A Song In My Heart:</strong> 5/10 - It's okay, but not as catchy as "She Bangs"!
•   <strong>Stevie at the Beach:</strong> 2/10 - Sand in my shoes! Not fun!
•   <strong>Up-Tight:</strong> 7/10 - Now we're talking! Gets me moving!
•   <strong>Down to Earth:</strong> 5/10 - It's alright, but I wanna reach for the stars!
•   <strong>I Was Made To Love Her:</strong> 8/10 - Oh yeah! This one makes me wanna dance with someone!
•   <strong>Eivets Rednow:</strong> 1/10 - Too weird! Sounds like someone playing records backward!
•   <strong>For Once in My Life:</strong> 6/10 - Good, but not my favorite.
•   <strong>My Cherie Amour:</strong> 7/10 - Sweet! I like to sing about love!
•   <strong>Signed, Sealed & Delivered:</strong> 9/10 - YES! A classic! I like this one A LOT!
•   <strong>Where I'm Coming From:</strong> 6/10 - Interesting, but I need more happy songs!
•   <strong>Music of My Mind:</strong> 7/10 - Getting deeper, I like it!
•   <strong>Talking Book:</strong> 10/10 - THIS IS IT! "Superstition" is the best! I can sing it all day!
•   <strong>Innervisions:</strong> 8/10 - A little serious, but good music!
•   <strong>Fulfillingness' First Finale:</strong> 7/10 - Good, but too long of a title!
•   <strong>Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> 9/10 - SO MANY SONGS! I like the energy!
•   <strong>Hotter Than July:</strong> 8/10 - Summertime fun! Makes me wanna party!
•   <strong>In Square Circle:</strong> 6/10 - It's okay, but not as catchy as the others.
•   <strong>Characters:</strong> 4/10 - Not so memorable, I forget the songs.
•   <strong>Conversation Peace:</strong> 5/10 - It's alright, but I prefer songs about love!
•   <strong>A Time to Love:</strong> 6/10 - A nice message, but I like more upbeat tunes!

That's how I would rate them! She Bangs!</div>
