  <h1>Description for image0.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this train ain't just transporting goods, it's hauling a whole load of awkward!

First off, it's a CSX engine, which makes it about as exciting as watching paint dry, but hey, at least it's got a number on it! 6513! What does it mean? Nobody knows! But it's there, in all its numerical glory!

And let's not forget the scenery. Oh wait, there isn't any! Just some random greenery that looks like it's trying to escape this photographic travesty!

The entire picture looks like a poorly rendered 3D model that was abandoned halfway through development! All it is missing is to be on a PlayStation 1 to give us nostalgia!</div>
