  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Good god, what an absolute clown fiesta of a final! Barcelona, you embarrassing bunch of overhyped tiki-taka merchants! With 54% possession, 19 shots, and a whopping 2.6 expected goals, you still managed to bottle it against Manchester United's 1.0 xG? You had 11 shots on target, and they only had 6. And their goalkeeper who is 37 YEARS OLD HAD 9 saves? Are you kidding me? 

And don't even get me started on your team overall rating of 5.0. 5.0?! The only thing worse than your defending is your finishing.

As for Manchester United, congratulations on the Champions League title. Rashford, you were a goddamn machine out there, scoring two goals and earning a well-deserved man-of-the-match award. Antony, your goal was an absolute screamer, and Tom Heaton, you geriatric wonder, nine saves? Nine?! You've just cemented your place in United folklore.

But let's be real, United, you were massively outplayed. A 6.6 team rating and a 1.0 xG? You relied on pure grit, clinical finishing, and an absolutely inspired performance from your goalkeeper. You were lucky to escape with the win.

But hey, a win is a win, right? Champions League trophy, courtesy of Barcelona's utterly pathetic defending and wasteful finishing. Enjoy it, United fans, because you just pulled off the ultimate smash-and-grab victory.

Barcelona, go back to Spain, hang your heads in shame, and maybe, just maybe, learn how to defend before you embarrass yourselves again on the European stage.</div>
