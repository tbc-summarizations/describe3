  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this team:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Paulo Gazzaniga:</strong> 3/10. Let's be real, he's a journeyman keeper, not a world-beater.

•   <strong>Mats Hummels:</strong> 7/10. Prime Hummels was a rock with excellent distribution.

•   <strong>Micky Van De Ven:</strong> 7/10. Rapidly emerging, very athletic.

•   <strong>Paolo Maldini:</strong> 10/10. Arguably the greatest defender ever. Flawless.

•   <strong>Hector Bellerin:</strong> 6/10. Had pace and attacking flair in his prime, but defensive frailties.

•   <strong>David Beckham:</strong> 8/10. Unmatched crossing and set-piece ability.

•   <strong>Richard Rios:</strong> 4/10. Nothing really impressive.

•   <strong>Kaka:</strong> 9/10. Electric pace, dribbling, and goalscoring from midfield in his prime.

•   <strong>Neymar Jr.:</strong> 9/10. When focused, one of the most dangerous and creative players.

•   <strong>Antoine Griezmann:</strong> 8/10. Versatile, hard-working, and a clinical finisher.

•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong> 10/10. An absolute goal machine.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

Overall: 7.5/10

<strong>Champions League Performance:</strong>

This team has attacking firepower to trouble any team in the Champions League. Maldini and Hummels would provide a solid base defensively. Beckham's delivery and Ronaldo's finishing would be lethal. However, the weak link is undoubtedly Gazzaniga in goal and Rios in Mid, and the potential lack of defensive cover from midfield would make them vulnerable against top opposition. They'd likely make the Quarterfinals.

<strong>World Cup Performance:</strong>

In the World Cup, the lack of defensive steel in midfield would be a major problem against organized teams. Also the team is just very unbalanced for tournament football, and too many holes would be exposed for any real shot at glory. They would struggle to make it out of the group stages.</div>
