  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's the unvarnished truth about these matchups:

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. Ireland 🇮🇪:</strong> The Dutch will systematically dismantle the Irish. Ireland's passion won't stand a chance against the Netherlands' tactical precision and superior attacking talent. Expect a clinical victory for the Oranje, leaving the Irish dreaming of better days.

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 vs. Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> This will be a cagey, tactical affair. Italy's defensive discipline will frustrate Poland's attacking ambitions. Expect a narrow, hard-fought win for Italy, possibly decided by a moment of brilliance or a Polish defensive lapse. Poland's lack of creativity in midfield will be their downfall.

•   <strong>Sweden 🇸🇪 vs. Armenia 🇦🇲:</strong> Sweden will ruthlessly exploit Armenia's defensive vulnerabilities. The Swedes' physical presence and aerial dominance will overwhelm the Armenians. A comfortable win for Sweden, with Armenia offering little resistance.

•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 vs. Luxembourg 🇱🇺:</strong> This is a massacre waiting to happen. Belgium's firepower is far too much for Luxembourg to handle. Expect a brutal, one-sided affair with Belgium running rampant.

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹 vs. Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> Portugal's attacking prowess, led by Ronaldo (if he's playing), will overwhelm Bosnia. Bosnia's defense simply won't be able to cope with the constant pressure. A resounding victory for Portugal.

•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 vs. Slovakia 🇸🇰:</strong> Denmark's midfield quality will control the game, dictating the tempo and creating scoring opportunities. Slovakia's defensive tactics will prove insufficient. A comfortable win for Denmark.

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸 vs. Scotland 🏴:</strong> Spain's possession-based style will suffocate Scotland. Scotland's grit and determination won't be enough to overcome Spain's superior technical skills. A convincing win for Spain.
