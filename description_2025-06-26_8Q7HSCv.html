  <h1>Description for 250px-Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the brutal truth about these Saudi clubs:

•   <strong>Al Fateh:</strong> 5/10. They're decent, but very inconsistent. They have flashes of brilliance but ultimately, they're forgettable.

•   <strong>Al Raed:</strong> 3/10. Usually just there to make up the numbers. They struggle to compete with the top teams and are often fighting relegation.

•   <strong>Al Taawoun:</strong> 6/10. A solid mid-table team that occasionally challenges for a spot in Asian competitions. Respectable, but not amazing.

•   <strong>Al-Ahli:</strong> 7/10. Historically a big team, but they've fallen on hard times recently. They need to rebuild to get back to their former glory.

•   <strong>Al-Ettifaq:</strong> 4/10. Another team that's just... there. They have occasional upsets, but generally unremarkable.

•   <strong>Al-Fayha FC:</strong> 5/10. A mid-table team that can sometimes surprise you, but they're not a consistent threat.

•   <strong>Al-Hilal:</strong> 10/10. The undisputed kings of Saudi football. Consistently winning titles and dominating the league. A powerhouse.

•   <strong>Al-Kholood:</strong> 2/10. Usually lower-table finishers. Don't expect much from them.

•   <strong>Al-Nassr:</strong> 9/10. They have the history and fanbase but always fall short of winning the league title.

•   <strong>Al-Okhdood:</strong> 1/10. A club that will likely struggle against all the big teams.

•   <strong>Al-Orobah:</strong> 2/10. Don't expect much from this club at all

•   <strong>Al-Qadsiah FC:</strong> 3/10. A club that will likely struggle against all the big teams.

•   <strong>Al-Riyadh:</strong> 1/10. A club that will likely struggle against all the big teams.

•   <strong>Al-Wehda:</strong> 3/10. A club that will likely struggle against all the big teams.

•   <strong>Damac:</strong> 5/10. Usually mid-table finishers. Don't expect much from them.

•   <strong>Ittihad:</strong> 9/10. The powerhouse, the real deal. Always contenders and should be feared.

•   <strong>Khaleej Club:</strong> 2/10. A club that will likely struggle against all the big teams.

•   <strong>Shabab Club:</strong> 6/10. Usually mid-table finishers. Don't expect much from them.</div>
