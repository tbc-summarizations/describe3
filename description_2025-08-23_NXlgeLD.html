  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Old Firm matchup with no holds barred:

<strong>Celtic's Setup:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> The attack has potential with Jota and Maeda, but both can be frustratingly inconsistent. Tierney provides some steel at left-back.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The goalkeeper is a major red flag. Sinisalo isn't near the level needed for this game. The midfield lacks bite, and Idah upfront is not a proven match-winner. Trusty is a liability in central defence.

<strong>Rangers' Setup:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Butland in goal is a significant advantage over Celtic. Aarons at right-back adds quality.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The central defence looks shaky, especially with Souttar. The attack relies heavily on Dessers, who is prone to inconsistency.

<strong>Prediction:</strong>

Based on these lineups, I'm predicting a <strong>2-1 victory for Rangers</strong>.

Here's why:

•   Celtic's goalkeeper is a massive liability, and Rangers will exploit this weakness. Expect at least one cheap goal conceded.
•   The Rangers midfield has enough steel to contain Celtic's creative players.
•   Dessers is a streaky player, but in a game like this, he'll find a way to score.
•   Celtic's defence is vulnerable, and Rangers will create chances.

Ultimately, Rangers have the better goalkeeper and a more solid defensive structure. They should edge this one.</div>
