  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to dissect these 2026 World Cup qualifiers with the honesty you demanded. No holding back!

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Luxembourg 🇱🇺 1-3 Northern Ireland 🇬🇧:</strong> Luxembourg, you're still Luxembourg. Northern Ireland, good job getting the win, but let's be real, it's Luxembourg. Not exactly a cause for celebration.
•   <strong>Slovakia 🇸🇰 2-0 Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> OH. MY. GOD. Germany, what the HELL was that?! Losing to Slovakia? They used to be the powerhouse! This is a disaster. An absolute embarrassment. Slovakia, congrats on the upset, but let's see if you can keep this momentum going against better teams.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮 2-2 Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> A draw? How boring. Sweden, I expected better from you. Slovenia, decent effort, but a win would have been far more impressive.
•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 4-0 Kosovo 🇽🇰:</strong> Switzerland, finally playing up to their potential! Kosovo, ouch. A 4-0 thrashing? You've got some serious work to do if you want to compete.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 0-0 Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> Yawn. A goalless draw? Both teams should be ashamed. What a snooze-fest!
•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷 5-1 Belarus 🇧🇾:</strong> Greece, now that's what I'm talking about! A dominant performance against Belarus. Keep it up! Belarus, one goal? That's your only highlight in a 5-1 humiliation.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>Iceland 🇮🇸 5-0 Azerbaijan 🇦🇿:</strong> Iceland, you absolute Vikings! Destroying Azerbaijan like that? Magnificent! Azerbaijan, pack your bags and go home. Utterly pathetic.
•   <strong>Ukraine 🇺🇦 0-2 France 🇫🇷:</strong> Expected. France is a far superior team, and they proved it. Ukraine, you put up a fight, but ultimately, the better team won.

<strong>Group E</strong>

•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪 2-3 Turkey 🇹🇷:</strong> Turkey, a narrow win against Georgia? That's not good enough! You should have dominated them. Georgia, commendable effort, but ultimately a loss is a loss.
•   <strong>Bulgaria 🇧🇬 0-3 Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> Spain, as expected. Bulgaria, maybe soccer isn't your thing? Just saying.

<strong>Group F</strong>

•   <strong>Armenia 🇦🇲 0-5 Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> Portugal, Ronaldo and the boys are here to party! Armenia, sorry, but you were just in the way of the fireworks.
•   <strong>Ireland 🇮🇪 2-2 Hungary 🇭🇺:</strong> A draw? Meh. Neither team impressed me. Mediocre.

<strong>Group G</strong>

•   <strong>Lithuania 🇱🇹 1-1 Malta 🇲🇹:</strong> Seriously? Lithuania and Malta? I almost fell asleep just typing that. A draw between these two is about as exciting as watching paint dry.
•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 1-1 Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> Another draw? The Netherlands, I expect much better from you. Poland, lucky to get a point, I'd say.

<strong>Group H</strong>

•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹 1-0 Cyprus 🇨🇾:</strong> A narrow win for Austria? Not impressive. Cyprus, at least you didn't get completely demolished.
•   <strong>San Marino 🇸🇲 0-6 Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> San Marino, you're basically a professional losing machine at this point. Bosnia, good job padding your stats against a terrible team.

<strong>Group I</strong>

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 5-0 Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> Italy, now that's more like it! Showcasing your skills against Estonia. Keep the momentum! Estonia, better luck next time... or the time after that... or ever.
•   <strong>Moldova 🇲🇩 0-4 Israel 🇮🇱:</strong> Israel, a convincing win against Moldova. Keep striving forward. Moldova, the next match should be better.

<strong>Group J</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 0-1 Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Wales, a narrow victory against Kazakhstan? Don't get cocky just because you can scrape by, it doesn't mean you are good.
•   <strong>Liechtenstein 🇱🇮 0-6 Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong> Belgium, you dominated the poor Liechtensteiners as expected. Liechtenstein, you're basically a punching bag for the rest of Europe.

<strong>Group K</strong>

•   <strong>Latvia 🇱🇻 0-1 Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> Serbia, you are just another team with zero talent. Get out of this World Cup now! Latvia, sorry that you were a victim of it.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 2-0 Andorra 🇦🇩:</strong> England, as expected, you beat Andorra. What did you want as praise, it is Andorra! I expect you to win every game from here on out!

<strong>Group L</strong>

•   <strong>Faroe Islands 🇫🇴 0-1 Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> Croatia, you won as expected. Get out there and be the best in the world. Faroe Islands, great effort to keep the score down!
•   <strong>Montenegro 🇲🇪 0-2 Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> Czechia, good solid win to move onward with the qualification. Montenegro, good attempt!

There you have it. Brutally honest, just as you asked. Some teams impressed, others disappointed, and some were just plain boring. Let the games continue!</div>
