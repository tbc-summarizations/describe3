  <div class="discord-text">Alright, judging from what I see, here's my honest take on Florian Wirtz:

<strong>8.5/10</strong>

Here's why:

•   <strong>Stats Don't Lie:</strong> He's consistently delivering goals and assists at a high level for Bayer Leverkusen. Those numbers are great for an attacking midfielder, especially considering his age.
•   <strong>Trophy Haul:</strong> Winning the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal with Leverkusen is nothing to scoff at, plus those other accolades. He's clearly been a key player in successful teams.
•   <strong>Young Age:</strong> Still only 21. He has so much room to improve and develop his game further. That potential is a massive factor.
•   <strong>Versatility:</strong> Capable of playing multiple attacking positions effectively. This makes him a valuable asset to any team.

The reason he doesn't get a straight 10 is that consistency over a long career is needed to be considered among the very best and needs to prove himself consistently at Champions League level. He needs to stay healthy and keep progressing. But he is already at a really high level and has the potential to be world-class.</div>
