  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on these results, no holds barred:

•   <strong>Lithuania 2-2 Finland:</strong> A draw? Really? Both of these teams are barely above amateur level. This result is an insult to football. Expecting both to not qualify.
•   <strong>England 3-0 Latvia:</strong> Predictable and boring. England should be putting more past a team like Latvia. Don't celebrate yet, you'll choke in the actual World Cup tournament as always.
•   <strong>Albania 3-0 Andorra:</strong> Okay, Albania at least did what they were supposed to. Beating a team like Andorra shouldn't even count as a win, though. Where's the challenge?
•   <strong>San Marino 1-5 Romania:</strong> San Marino actually scored? Pathetic display by Romania conceding to the worst national team on the planet.
•   <strong>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina 2-1 Cyprus:</strong> Close, but Bosnia should've dominated. Don't expect them to make any real impact in the qualifiers, let alone the World Cup.
•   <strong>Poland 2-0 Malta:</strong> Another snoozefest. Poland barely scraping by against Malta? They should be ashamed. Lewandowski can't carry them forever.
•   <strong>Moldova 2-3 Estonia:</strong> This is the definition of a meaningless match between two terrible teams. No one cares.
•   <strong>Liechtenstein 0-2 Kazakhstan:</strong> Honestly, who even keeps track of these games? Both teams will be lucky to get any more points in the group stage.
•   <strong>Gibraltar 0-4 Czechia:</strong> Should have been way more than 4. Embarrassing for Gibraltar, as usual.
•   <strong>Montenegro 1-0 Faroe Islands:</strong> A single goal win? These teams are basically interchangeable in terms of mediocrity.
•   <strong>North Macedonia 1-1 Wales:</strong> Wales bottled it. Should be winning against North Macedonia.
•   <strong>Israel 2-4 Norway:</strong> Norway finally showing some promise. Haaland can't carry the whole team, but it's a good sign. Still not convinced they'll make a deep run in the World Cup though.</div>
