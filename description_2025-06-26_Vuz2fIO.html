  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on each of these American clubs and their greatness in the country, ranked out of 10:

•   <strong>Atlanta United: 9/10.</strong> They came in hot, set attendance records, won a title quickly, and built a strong brand. They've cooled off a bit, but the impact they had on MLS is undeniable.
•   <strong>Austin FC: 6/10.</strong> Good vibes and a cool stadium, but let's be real, they haven't achieved much yet. More hype than substance currently.
•   <strong>CF Montreal: 4/10.</strong> They're Canadian, but I'll include them. Constantly overshadowed, ownership issues, and a revolving door of players. Not a powerhouse.
•   <strong>Charlotte FC: 3/10.</strong> Expansion team struggles are expected, but they haven't shown anything particularly inspiring yet. 
•   <strong>Chicago Fire FC: 5/10.</strong> Historically important, but massively underachieving for a major market. They need a serious reboot.
•   <strong>Colorado Rapids: 4/10.</strong> Always seem to be quietly existing. Rarely exciting, rarely terrible. Just... there.
•   <strong>Columbus Crew: 7/10.</strong> They have history and a dedicated fanbase, especially after nearly moving. Decent team, but not elite.
•   <strong>D.C. United: 6/10.</strong> Used to be a dynasty, now they're a shadow of their former selves. Needs a complete overhaul to get back to relevance.
•   <strong>FC Cincinnati: 7/10.</strong> Went from laughing stock to a legitimately good team fast. They have potential to keep climbing.
•   <strong>FC Dallas: 6/10.</strong> Consistently develops good young players, but rarely makes a deep playoff run. 
•   <strong>Houston Dynamo: 5/10.</strong> Occasionally flashes of brilliance, but mostly mediocre. Not a team that strikes fear into opponents.
•   <strong>Inter Miami: 4/10.</strong> Overhyped because of Beckham, but haven't achieved much on the field. They need to start winning.
•   <strong>LA Galaxy: 8/10.</strong> A historical giant with a ton of MLS Cups, but they've been coasting on that reputation for too long.
•   <strong>Los Angeles FC: 9/10.</strong> Dominant on the field, a great stadium, and a real rivalry with the Galaxy. They've become a force in MLS.
•   <strong>Minnesota United FC: 5/10.</strong> A decent team with a cool stadium, but haven't reached the top tier yet. 
•   <strong>Nashville SC: 7/10.</strong> Solid defensively and have made a splash in the playoffs a few times. A tough team to play against.
•   <strong>New England Revolution: 6/10.</strong> Often overlooked, but they've been consistently decent for a long time.
•   <strong>New York City FC: 7/10.</strong> A title win gives them a boost, but they still lack a true home. 
•   <strong>New York Red Bulls: 6/10.</strong> Develop young talent, but rarely make a serious championship push.
•   <strong>Orlando City SC: 6/10.</strong> Some good moments, but inconsistent. Need to find more stability.
•   <strong>Philadelphia Union: 8/10.</strong> One of the best teams in the league right now, developing young talent and playing an exciting style.
•   <strong>Portland Timbers: 8/10.</strong> Intense atmosphere, loyal fans, and a history of success. They know how to win in the playoffs.
•   <strong>Real Salt Lake: 5/10.</strong> Can be dangerous in the playoffs, but inconsistent overall.
•   <strong>San Diego FC: 1/10.</strong> They're not even playing yet. 
•   <strong>San Jose Earthquakes: 3/10.</strong> A mess. Consistently one of the worst teams in the league.
•   <strong>Seattle Sounders FC: 9/10.</strong> A model franchise with a great fanbase, consistent success, and a CONCACAF Champions League title. 
•   <strong>Sporting Kansas City: 7/10.</strong> Has a great stadium and a history of success under Peter Vermes, but have been struggling a bit lately.
•   <strong>St. Louis City SC: 8/10.</strong> An instant hit with incredible fan support and a surprisingly good team.
•   <strong>Toronto FC: 5/10.</strong> Similar to Montreal, consistently shadowed and not very good.
•   <strong>Vancouver Whitecaps: 4/10.</strong> They're Canadian, but rarely make any noise in MLS.</div>
