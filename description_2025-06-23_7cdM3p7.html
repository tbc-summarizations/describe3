  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back on these predictions:

â€¢   <strong>United States ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ vs. China ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³:</strong> USA wins 5-0. China simply doesn't have the quality to compete. Expect a dominant performance from the Americans, with China struggling to even get out of their own half.

â€¢   <strong>Serbia ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸ vs. Albania ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡±:</strong> Serbia wins 3-1. Pure passion and aggression fuel this match. Serbia's quality shines through, but Albania will fight tooth and nail, even if it means dirty tackles and protests.

â€¢   <strong>South Korea ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· vs. North Korea ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡µ:</strong> South Korea wins 4-0. The divide in quality is staggering. North Korea will be outclassed and outplayed in every aspect. Expect a politically charged match with more tension than actual football skill.

â€¢   <strong>Ukraine ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ vs. Russia ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º:</strong> Russia wins 2-1. A heated, brutal encounter. Emotions run high, expect a physical game with lots of fouls. Russia will edge it out, exploiting Ukraine's defensive vulnerabilities.

â€¢   <strong>India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ vs. Pakistan ğŸ‡µğŸ‡°:</strong> India wins 2-0. India has a clear advantage in footballing infrastructure. Pakistan will try to defend for their lives, but India will break them down eventually.

â€¢   <strong>Brazil ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· vs. Argentina ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·:</strong> Brazil wins 3-2. A classic, no holds barred South American clash. Expect goals, drama, and questionable tackles. Brazil's firepower will prove too much for Argentina to handle.

â€¢   <strong>Armenia ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡² vs. Azerbaijan ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿:</strong> Azerbaijan wins 1-0. A tense, low-scoring affair. Not the most exciting football, but expect passion and frustration. Azerbaijan edges it out due to Armenia's defensive errors.

â€¢   <strong>Israel ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± vs. Palestine ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¸:</strong> Israel wins 3-0. A game with immense political weight. Israel's better organization and funding will lead to a decisive victory. Expect protests, boycotts, and far more than just football on display.</div>
