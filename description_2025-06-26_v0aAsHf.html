  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of the English clubs you listed, rated out of 10 based on their overall "greatness" in the country's footballing landscape:

•   <strong>AFC Bournemouth: 2/10</strong> – Let's be real, they're a small club with a recent Premier League stint. Not much history beyond that.

•   <strong>Arsenal: 8.5/10</strong> – Historically a massive club. Incredible history with iconic managers and legends. Been underwhelming recently, but the history is undeniable.

•   <strong>Aston Villa: 6/10</strong> – Decent history, a European Cup, but haven't been consistently elite. Inconsistent, but has periods of success.

•   <strong>Brentford: 3/10</strong> – A good story recently, but historically pretty insignificant. Recent success is a good story, but nothing to write home about beyond that.

•   <strong>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: 4/10</strong> – Only recently become a decent club with an exciting brand of football, but no real history.

•   <strong>Chelsea: 8/10</strong> – The Roman Abramovich era was transformational. Recent success is unquestionable, but pre-2000s, they weren't always a powerhouse.

•   <strong>Crystal Palace: 3/10</strong> – A yo-yo club with occasional flair. No real trophy pedigree.

•   <strong>Everton: 5/10</strong> – Used to be a big club with titles. Now just linger in mediocrity. History doesn't hide the fact that they're in a shambles.

•   <strong>Fulham: 3/10</strong> – Similar to Bournemouth, they're a small club that are in and out of the prem.

•   <strong>Ipswich Town: 3/10</strong> – Another club that used to be a giant. Now pretty shit.

•   <strong>Leicester City: 7/10</strong> – The miracle title wins were a massive boost. But the club has been mediocre since then and will likely be very shortlived.

•   <strong>Liverpool: 9/10</strong> – An absolute giant. European pedigree. Historic success. What else can you say?

•   <strong>Manchester City: 9.5/10</strong> – Ruthless dominance in recent years. Money talks, and they've bought their way to being a footballing giant.

•   <strong>Manchester United: 9/10</strong> – The Fergie era cemented their place in history. Been a joke since, but the history is there.

•   <strong>Newcastle United: 6/10</strong> – Decent history, but mostly known for their passionate fanbase and for nearly going bankrupt under Mike Ashley.

•   <strong>Nottingham Forest: 5/10</strong> – A European Cup pedigree, but a joke for decades. A sleeping giant that hasn't woken up yet.

•   <strong>Southampton: 4/10</strong> – Nice academy, but lack ambition. Always happy to sell their best players to bigger clubs.

•   <strong>Tottenham Hotspur: 6/10</strong> – Always bottle it. Known for being entertaining but trophyless.

•   <strong>West Ham United: 5/10</strong> – A proper footballing club. Won a trophy recently but are often disappointing.

•   <strong>Wolverhampton Wanderers: 4/10</strong> – Decent for a few years but have been a terrible club for the last couple of decades.

These ratings are my brutal, honest opinions, based on history, recent success, and overall cultural impact.</div>
