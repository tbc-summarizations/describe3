  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's the brutally honest roast of Group A's Euro 2024 qualifiers:

<strong>Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> Oh, look, the former world champions <em>managed</em> to qualify. After a pathetic loss to Scotland, they only managed to recover because they played against complete jokes like Cyprus and Georgia (for the most part). Honestly, without an easy group, they'd probably be sitting at home. Also, without Gavi's injury, they'd struggle to qualify. Their so-called "golden generation" is long gone, and what we're left with is a team living off past glories.

<strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> You beat Spain in the first half of the qualifiers and secured qualification. Congratulations, you won't make it out of the group stages and will disappoint your entire fanbase and waste their time for the duration of the tournament. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame, as it'll probably be the last time anyone cares about Scottish football.

<strong>Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Haaland and Odegaard and <em>still</em> couldn't qualify? I've got no sympathy for them. Haaland is nothing without De Bruyne and Odegaard is overrated. What a joke. 

<strong>Georgia 🇬🇪:</strong> Congratulations on qualifying, but let's be real. You only got there because of the Nations League loophole. They probably got lucky draws and will get absolutely hammered in the Euro tournament. Enjoy the participation trophy.

<strong>Cyprus 🇨🇾:</strong> Someone had to be the punching bag, right? Congrats on managing to score 3 goals in 8 games, what an achievement! Should be very proud of that.</div>
