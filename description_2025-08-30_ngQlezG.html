  <h1>Description for 250px-FC_Internazionale_Milano_2021.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this Inter Milan lineup apart with some cold, hard ratings:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Josep Martínez (GK): 6/10.</strong> He is a decent shot-stopper, but still lacks the experience and command to be a truly top-tier keeper. He is a bit of a gamble in a team with Scudetto aspirations.

•   <strong>Federico Dimarco (LB): 7.5/10.</strong> A workhorse with a great engine and decent technical ability. He's not the most defensively sound, but he is a threat going forward and has a good cross.

•   <strong>Alessandro Bastoni (CB): 8/10.</strong> Inter's best defender. He's composed, reads the game well, and is comfortable playing out from the back. A really important player.

•   <strong>Yann Bisseck (CB): 6/10.</strong> He is still unproven, and might be a liability against top-quality opposition.

•   <strong>Denzel Dumfries (RB): 6.5/10.</strong> His defending is often questionable and I don't think he is a great passer of the ball

•   <strong>Nicolò Barella (CM): 8/10.</strong> An absolute powerhouse in midfield. He is tireless, aggressive, and has a knack for arriving late in the box. A real driving force for the team.

•   <strong>Davide Frattesi (CM): 6.5/10.</strong> He is okay but unspectacular. 

•   <strong>Hakan Çalhanoğlu (CM): 7.5/10.</strong> A solid deep-lying playmaker with great technique and a good range of passing. He lacks pace and mobility, but makes up for it with his vision.

•   <strong>Lautaro Martínez (ST): 9/10.</strong> The main man. He is a clinical finisher, has great movement, and leads the line brilliantly. One of the best strikers in Serie A.

•   <strong>Marcus Thuram (ST): 7/10.</strong> He is a good foil for Lautaro, but lacks the consistent goalscoring threat to be a true top striker.

•   <strong>Mehdi Taremi (ST): 6.5/10.</strong> Useful squad player, but ultimately a downgrade on what they had last season.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7.5/10</strong>

This team is pretty good but relies heavily on a few key players like Bastoni and Lautaro, and the overall quality of the team has slightly gone down. This lineup is good enough to compete for a Champions League spot, but I just don't see them going all the way in the competition or winning the league. They lack a certain cutting edge and depth in key positions, and some of the players simply aren't good enough to play at the highest level.</div>
