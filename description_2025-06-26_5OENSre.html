  <h1>Description for 250px-Flag_of_Argentina.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rating of Argentinian clubs, with detailed reasoning:

•   <strong>Aldosivi: 2/10.</strong> Historically a smaller club, with little national impact. They've had brief spells in the top division, but are largely irrelevant in the grand scheme.

•   <strong>Argentinos Juniors: 6/10.</strong> One of the more respectable clubs, but their glory days are long gone. Maradona played there, but they haven't sustained any dominance for decades.

•   <strong>Atletico Tucuman: 4/10.</strong> They've had some moments, but are typically a mid-table team at best. No sustained success to warrant a higher rating.

•   <strong>Banfield: 5/10.</strong> Won one title, but mostly an unremarkable club. Can be decent at times but far from a powerhouse.

•   <strong>Barracas Central: 1/10.</strong> A recent addition to the top flight, with no significant history. A novelty team at best.

•   <strong>Belgrano: 4/10.</strong> Historically a second-tier team, with few notable accomplishments in the Primera División.

•   <strong>Boca Juniors: 10/10.</strong> One of the giants. Immense history, international success, and a massive fan base. No explanation needed.

•   <strong>Central Cordoba: 2/10.</strong> A smaller club with little to no national recognition.

•   <strong>Defense Y Justicia: 6/10.</strong> Won the Sudamericana title, so have a better rating than most.

•   <strong>Deportivo Riestra: 1/10.</strong> No history, insignificant club.

•   <strong>Estudiantes: 8/10.</strong> A club with a good history, including multiple titles and a strong tradition.

•   <strong>Gimnasia Y Esgrima: 4/10.</strong> More known for Maradona's brief managerial stint than actual on-field success.

•   <strong>Godoy Cruz: 3/10.</strong> From the province of Mendoza. Minimal national relevance.

•   <strong>Huracan: 5/10.</strong> Some historical significance but no real relevance recently.

•   <strong>Independiente: 8/10.</strong> Historically one of the "big five," but fallen on hard times. Still have a rich history and a respectable number of titles.

•   <strong>Independiente Rivadavia: 1/10.</strong> Very small club, unlikely to be successful in the top tier.

•   <strong>Instituto: 3/10.</strong> Very little success and impact on the Argentinian game.

•   <strong>Lanus: 6/10.</strong> They've managed to win titles, so are a big club in Argentina.

•   <strong>Newell's Old Boys: 7/10.</strong> Rosario club with significant history. They have history, but in comparison, they are not a massive club.

•   <strong>Platense: 2/10.</strong> They've had moments in the top division. But have no significance

•   <strong>Racing Club: 7/10.</strong> Another of the "big five," but inconsistent. Have a history, but not consistent.

•   <strong>River Plate: 10/10.</strong> The other giant. Massive history, international success, and a huge fan base. No debate.

•   <strong>Rosario Central: 7/10.</strong> The other Rosario club. Not on the same level as River or Boca, but a significant club nonetheless.

•   <strong>San Lorenzo: 7/10.</strong> The last of the "big five." Some major success, but nothing that would be sustained.

•   <strong>San Martin: 2/10.</strong> No success really.

•   <strong>Sarmiento: 2/10.</strong> Have really only been in the top division for a short time.

•   <strong>Talleres: 5/10.</strong> A decent-sized club from Cordoba, they have some cup success.

•   <strong>Tigre: 3/10.</strong> A smaller team, but a decent fan base.

•   <strong>Union: 3/10.</strong> Unremarkable club.

•   <strong>Velez Sarsfield: 7/10.</strong> A good team but have not replicated it for a long time.</div>
