  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to tear this list apart. Here's my brutally honest take:

•   <strong>Another Star - Stevie Wonder:</strong> Solid start, can't argue with Stevie. But there are so much songs starting with letter A this pick is pretty noob.
•   <strong>Bring Da Ruckus - Wu-Tang Clan:</strong> Good choice, raw energy. Definitely a high-tier B song.
•   <strong>Carry That Weight - The Beatles:</strong> Overrated Beatles song. Should have gone with "Come Together".
•   <strong>Dogs - Pink Floyd:</strong> Yes! Absolute masterpiece. No debate.
•   <strong>Earthmover - Have A Nice Life:</strong> Edgy, but ultimately pretentious. Overstays its welcome.
•   <strong>Fourth of July - Sufjan Stevens:</strong> Great song, but way too depressing. Not enjoyable to listen to repeatedly.
•   <strong>Gangsta's Paradise - Coolio:</strong> Nostalgic, but musically basic. Overplayed, and not even Coolio's best work.
•   <strong>House of Balloons / Glass Table Girls - The Weeknd:</strong> Great choice. Peak Weeknd.
•   <strong>I'm God - Clams Casino:</strong> Amazing beat.
•   <strong>Jigsaw Falling Into Place - Radiohead:</strong> Not even top 5 Radiohead songs.
•   <strong>Korowód - Marek Grechuta:</strong> Fine, if you're into obscure Polish music. But hardly the best "K" song of all time.
•   <strong>LONG SEASON - Fishmans:</strong> Never heard of it, but I am willing to try.
•   <strong>Master of Puppets - Metallica:</strong> Undeniable. Legendary. End of discussion.
•   <strong>N.Y. State of Mind - Nas:</strong> Absolutely. This is perfection.
•   <strong>On GP - Death Grips:</strong> Intense and groundbreaking. Good choice.
•   <strong>PRIDE. - Kendrick Lamar:</strong> Excellent. Kendrick always delivers.
•   <strong>Question! - System of a Down:</strong> Solid SOAD track, but there are better options.
•   <strong>Rigor Mormist - Laura Shigihara:</strong> Okay, this is straight up garbage. Why?
•   <strong>Starless - King Crimson:</strong> Beautiful, atmospheric, but can be a bit boring for some.
•   <strong>Transdermal Celebration - Ween:</strong> Bizarre and brilliant. I approve.
•   <strong>Under Pressure - Queen & David Bowie:</strong> Iconic, powerful. No complaints.
•   <strong>Vigilante - Willie Colón & Héctor Lavoe:</strong> Great choice if you're a salsa fan.
•   <strong>Wonderful Life - Black:</strong> Depressing and beautiful, but there are so much better.
•   <strong>Xtal - Aphex Twin:</strong> A classic. Essential electronic music.
•   <strong>You Shook Me All Night Long - AC/DC:</strong> Total banger. Can't argue with this.
•   <strong>Zombie - The Cranberries:</strong> Overplayed radio hit. Pass.

Overall, a mixed bag. Some excellent choices, some questionable ones, and some that are just plain awful. Needs work.</div>
