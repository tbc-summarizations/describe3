  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal, honest, and detailed prediction for the Demon List Cup group stages, leaving no room for sentimentality:

<strong>Group A</strong>

1.  <strong>United States 🇺🇸:</strong>  Home advantage gives them a significant edge. They'll bully Russia and Spain, and Korea won't stand a chance.
2.  <strong>Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> Enough technical skill and tactical familiarity to edge out Russia. The Koreans are a complete non-factor.
3.  <strong>Russia 🇷🇺:</strong>  A complete embarrassment, they will struggle to score goals, and their tactics are outdated. They'll get absolutely destroyed by USA and Spain.
4.  <strong>South Korea 🇰🇷:</strong>  Forget about it. They will be the punching bag of the group.

<strong>Group B</strong>

1.  <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> Their organization and depth will be too much for the others. They'll control every game.
2.  <strong>Canada 🇨🇦:</strong>  Athletic and determined, but lack the sheer quality. They'll manage to sneak through past Finland and Poland.
3.  <strong>Finland 🇫🇮:</strong>  Feisty and disciplined, but ultimately not enough firepower to progress. They will be a tough match for Poland
4.  <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong>  Absolutely dreadful. Will not win a single game.

<strong>Group C</strong>

1.  <strong>France 🇫🇷:</strong> Raw talent and flair.  They will dominate with their offensive power.
2.  <strong>Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> Tactically sound, but the French are just too good. They'll beat the others comfortably.
3.  <strong>Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong>  A good team, but not consistent. They will not have a very good time.
4.  <strong>Australia 🇦🇺:</strong>  Too far behind the other teams in skill. They are going home early.

<strong>Group D</strong>

1.  <strong>Brazil 🇧🇷:</strong>  Pure attacking prowess, and they will simply outscore everyone.
2.  <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> A little too old, but they'll edge out Romania with their experience.
3.  <strong>Romania 🇷🇴:</strong>  Underestimated, but ultimately lack the clinical edge to advance.
4.  <strong>New Zealand 🇳🇿:</strong>  Absolutely hopeless. Will be completely outclassed in every game.

<strong>Group E</strong>

1.  <strong>Argentina 🇦🇷:</strong>  Pure passion will overcome everything in their path.
2.  <strong>Italy 🇮🇹:</strong>  Organized and tactically sound.  They'll edge out Mexico, whose attacking game has flaws.
3.  <strong>Mexico 🇲🇽:</strong>  Inconsistent. They will not make it through their rivals.
4.  <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong>  Lacking the drive. They will be destroyed in their group

<strong>Group F</strong>

1.  <strong>Norway 🇳🇴:</strong>  A dark horse. They will surprise everyone with their skill.
2.  <strong>Chile 🇨🇱:</strong>  They will struggle to create chances. Their offense won't be enough
3.  <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong>  Incredibly limited. Will struggle in most games.
4.  <strong>Moldova 🇲🇩:</strong>  The worst team. Will be humiliated.</div>
