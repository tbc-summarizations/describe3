  <h1>Description for 800px-FC_Shakhter_Karagandy_Logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Shakhter Karagandy's 2013-14 Europa League campaign gets a brutal <strong>3/10</strong>.

Here's why:

•   <strong>Champions League Failure:</strong> Winning the Kazakhstan Premier League earned them a Champions League spot, which they squandered by failing to qualify for the group stage. The Celtic collapse was pathetic.
•   <strong>Initial Hope:</strong> The wins against BATE and Skënderbeu showed some promise. Beating BATE was genuinely impressive, even if BATE were a bit of a shadow of their former selves. Skënderbeu is a nothing team and they almost blew the tie.
•   <strong>Group Stage Catastrophe:</strong> The Europa League group stage was an utter disaster. No wins against AZ Alkmaar, PAOK, or Maccabi Haifa? Embarrassing. They're a team that should be expected to win at least a game or two against that competition.
•   <strong>Goals Scored/Conceded:</strong> 5 goals scored and 10 conceded is unacceptable. It shows a lack of attacking prowess and defensive solidity.
•   <strong>Final Position:</strong> Finishing dead last in the group is the ultimate failure. It confirms that they were the weakest team in the group by a wide margin.

Essentially, they overachieved to get to the group stage and then completely embarrassed themselves once they were there. That doesn't deserve a good rating. They got lucky against Skënderbeu. They bottled it against Celtic. They stank up the place in the group stage. 3/10 is generous.</div>
