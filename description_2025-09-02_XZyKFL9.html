  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because this club coefficient ranking for the 2025/26 season is wild in places. Here's my brutally honest reaction:

<strong>Top Tier:</strong>

•   <strong>Real Madrid at #1 is no surprise.</strong> They practically live in the Champions League final.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich at #2 is expected.</strong> They're a German machine, consistently deep in the Champions League.
•   <strong>Inter Milan at #3 is honestly a bit high.</strong> They've had some good runs, but this implies they've been more consistently elite than I see them.
•   <strong>Manchester City at #4 is fine.</strong> If they haven't imploded by then, they'll be near the top.
•   <strong>Liverpool at #5 is realistic.</strong> They always seem to be in the mix.
•   <strong>PSG at #6 is about right.</strong> They'll have Neymar's retirement tour and Mbappe on a ridiculous contract, but can they ever actually win the CL?
•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen at #7...Woah!</strong> If they're still playing like they are now under Xabi Alonso, then this placement would be deserved, however the fact this has occurred is still quite surprising to see.
•   <strong>Dortmund at #8, okay, maybe.</strong> They've got youth and a good structure, but being this consistently good is a big ask.
•   <strong>Barcelona at #9 is still a bit too generous.</strong> They're in rebuild mode and probably overspending to get there. I don't see them as a top 8 team by 2026.
•   <strong>Benfica at #10 seems fair.</strong> They consistently develop and sell talent, and tend to perform well.

<strong>Mid-Table Madness:</strong>

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid at #11 is reasonable.</strong> They'll still be grinding out results somehow.
•   <strong>Chelsea at #12? I seriously doubt it.</strong> Even with all the money, they can't seem to get their act together. They will likely struggle in the Prem, with any success coming in the Conference League.
•   <strong>Arsenal at #13 is too high.</strong> They'll either be brilliant or completely fall apart; they have no in-between.
•   <strong>Roma at #14? Nah.</strong> Too reliant on Mourinho magic, and that can only last so long.
•   <strong>Eintracht Frankfurt at #15 is a major surprise.</strong> Good for them if they've broken into the elite. I like the city a lot.
•   <strong>Manchester United at #16 is a joke.</strong> They are a meme club. If they are lucky, they might make the Europa League.
•   <strong>Atalanta at #17 is not believable.</strong> They had that one brilliant spell, but I think other clubs are catching up with their recruitment style.
•   <strong>West Ham United at #18? Hell no.</strong> They won't be this good. They will probably get relegated or barely escape relegation.
•   <strong>Feyenoord at #19 is a surprise.</strong> They might do really well in the CL or EL, but they will not maintain such a ranking.
•   <strong>Club Brugge at #20 is definitely ambitious.</strong> They'd have to be consistently pulling off upsets in Europe to justify this.

<strong>Further Down the Rabbit Hole:</strong>

•   <strong>Milan at #21? Not too sure.</strong> Again, they are quite inconsistent.
•   <strong>PSV at #22 is fine.</strong> I can see them getting a decent run of results in Europe.
•   <strong>Sporting CP at #23 is a pleasant surprise.</strong>
•   <strong>Fiorentina at #24? What?</strong> They can't stay a relevant threat in the Seria A.
•   <strong>Tottenham Hotspur at #25 is delusional.</strong> They will probably get relegated, their only hope is Kane coming back and saving them.
•   <strong>RB Leipzig at #26? Alright.</strong> Probably a good place for them.
•   <strong>Juventus at #27? I doubt it.</strong> They are in shambles after the sanctions.
•   <strong>Lazio at #28 is a surprise.</strong> No chance in hell they would make it this high.
•   <strong>Villarreal at #29? Possible.</strong>
•   <strong>Lille at #30, sounds right.</strong>
•   <strong>Napoli at #31? Quite generous.</strong> They were good last season but its very rare for Napoli to remain this well for more than a season.
•   <strong>Real Sociedad at #32? Maybe.</strong> Not super unlikely, but they lack the funds to maintain such a high level.
•   <strong>Porto at #33? Sure, why not.</strong>
•   <strong>Rangers at #34? Doubt it.</strong>
•   <strong>Ajax at #35 is fine.</strong>
•   <strong>Bodø/Glimt at #36 is shocking.</strong> I'm not sure they will maintain this form.
•   <strong>Olympiacos at #37? Seems right.</strong>
•   <strong>Real Betis at #38? Unlikely.</strong>
•   <strong>AZ Alkmaar at #39? Quite hopeful.</strong>
•   <strong>Copenhagen at #40? Maybe.</strong>
•   <strong>Marseille at #41? Sure.</strong>
•   <strong>Aston Villa at #42? Definitely no.</strong> Not possible for them to maintain such a high level.
•   <strong>Fenerbahçe at #43? Sure.</strong>
•   <strong>Monaco at #44? I doubt it.</strong>
•   <strong>Lyon at #45? Possible.</strong>
•   <strong>Union Saint-Gilloise at #46 is unexpected.</strong> I don't think they would reach such heights.
•   <strong>Galatasaray at #47? Possible.</strong>
•   <strong>Slavia Prague at #48, a little bit optimistic.</strong>
•   <strong>RB Salzburg at #49, okay.</strong>
•   <strong>Dinamo Zagreb at #50? Fine.</strong>
•   <strong>Gent at #51? Maybe.</strong>
•   <strong>Sevilla at #52 is a slight underestimation.</strong> They are the kings of the Europa League, they should be ranked higher.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk at #53? Not bad.</strong>
•   <strong>PAOK at #54? Who would've thought?</strong>
•   <strong>Braga at #55? Sure.</strong>
•   <strong>Viktoria Plzen at #56 is somewhat hopeful.</strong>
•   <strong>Qarabağ at #57? No way.</strong>
•   <strong>Celtic at #58 is reasonable.</strong>
•   <strong>Rennes at #59? Unlikely.</strong>
•   <strong>Ferencvaros at #60 is a bold placement.</strong>
•   <strong>Red Star Belgrade at #61? Really?</strong>
•   <strong>Athletic Bilbao at #62 is okay.</strong>
•   <strong>Djurgården at #63? Never.</strong>
•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava at #64? No comment.</strong>
•   <strong>Anderlecht at #65? Unrealistic.</strong>
•   <strong>Basel at #66? Not possible.</strong>
•   <strong>Maccabi Tel Aviv at #67 is doubtful.</strong>
•   <strong>Legia Warsaw at #68? Who cares.</strong>
•   <strong>SC Freiburg at #69? Lol.</strong>
•   <strong>Rapid Wien at #70 is laughable.</strong>
•   <strong>Midtjylland at #71 is unexpected.</strong>
•   <strong>Sparta Prague at #72? Not realistic.</strong>
•   <strong>Young Boys at #73? Never.</strong>
•   <strong>Sturm Graz at #74? Impossible.</strong>
•   <strong>Union Berlin at #75 is generous.</strong>
•   <strong>Partizan at #76? Okay.</strong>
•   <strong>Molde at #77? Unlikely.</strong>
•   <strong>Lugano at #78? Doubtful.</strong>
•   <strong>Ludogorets at #79? Maybe.</strong>
•   <strong>LASK at #80? Why not.</strong>

<strong>Overall, this ranking feels optimistic for many mid-tier teams and seriously underrates some of the more consistent performers.</strong> Also, there is no way Union Berlin will remain on the level where they are now.

That's my honest take. Some surprises, some laughs, and a whole lot of "I don't think so" moments.</div>
