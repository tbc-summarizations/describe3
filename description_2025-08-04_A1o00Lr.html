  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are my brutally honest predictions for the UEFA Conference League Third Qualifying Round, with aggregate scores:

<strong>Champions Path</strong>

•   <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana 🇸🇮 vs. Egnatia 🇦🇱: 5-1</strong>. Egnatia is the weakest team here and Ljubljana is the team of higher class.
•   <strong>Milsami Orhei 🇲🇩 vs. Virtus 🇸🇲: 3-0</strong>. Milsami should be able to handle a team from San Marino with ease.
•   <strong>Differdange 03 🇱🇺 vs. Levadia 🇪🇪: 2-3</strong>. A close one, but Levadia has a bit more European experience and better squad depth.
•   <strong>Víkingur 🇫🇴 vs. Linfield 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁮󠁩󠁲󠁿: 1-4</strong>. Linfield has a pedigree in European competitions, and Vikingur are just not good enough.

<strong>Main Path</strong>

•   <strong>Rapid Wien 🇦🇹 vs. Dundee United 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: 4-2</strong>. Rapid has a stronger squad and home advantage.
•   <strong>Sparta Prague 🇨🇿 vs. Ararat-Armenia 🇦🇲: 6-0</strong>. Sparta Prague are simply a far better team with more quality.
•   <strong>AZ Alkmaar 🇳🇱 vs. Vaduz 🇱🇮: 5-1</strong>. Vaduz will get crushed here as AZ Alkmaar is one of the highest class teams in the competetion.
•   <strong>Lugano 🇨🇭 vs. Celje 🇸🇮: 3-1</strong>. Lugano is slightly stronger and has a better track record in Europe.
•   <strong>KÍ Klaksvík 🇫🇴 vs. Neman Grodno 🇧🇾: 1-2</strong>. Neman Grodno are slight favorites due to their more organized defense.

•   <strong>Víkingur Reykjavík 🇮🇸 vs. Brøndby 🇩🇰: 0-4</strong>. Brøndby is a significantly stronger team and should dominate.
•   <strong>Hajduk Split 🇭🇷 vs. Dinamo City 🇦🇱: 7-0</strong>. Hajduk will make short work of this minnow side.
•   <strong>Anderlecht 🇧🇪 vs. Sheriff Tiraspol 🇲🇩: 3-1</strong>. Anderlecht has more class and should get the job done at home.
•   <strong>Lausanne-Sport 🇨🇭 vs. Astana 🇰🇿: 2-2 (Astana wins on penalties)</strong>. A tight affair that Astana might edge through their experience.
•   <strong>Larne 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁮󠁩󠁲󠁿 vs. Santa Clara 🇵🇹: 1-4</strong>. Santa Clara is a stronger team with more European experience.
