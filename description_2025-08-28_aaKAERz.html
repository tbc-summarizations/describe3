  <div class="discord-text">Alright, bet. As if I'm Iggy? Okay, here we go:

•   <strong>Blunted On Reality:</strong> 2/10. Seriously? The Fugees were still finding themselves here. It's like a rough draft before they really popped. And the outfits? Tragic, honey, tragic.
•   <strong>The Score:</strong> 8/10. Okay, now we're talking. This is where they got the formula right. "Ready or Not" still slaps. But let's be real, it's a group effort.
•   <strong>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> 9/10. A classic. I gotta respect it. The rhymes, the feels...okay, Lauryn did her thing. But the production is what really elevates it.
•   <strong>MTV Unplugged No. 2.0:</strong> 3/10. Okay, girl, I get it, you're "real." But that ain't music to me. This is just her screaming at a guitar and moping on stage.</div>
