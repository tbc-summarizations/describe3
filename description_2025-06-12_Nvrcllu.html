  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's the brutally honest truth about this Manchester City squad:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Manager: Pep Guardiola (ESP): 10/10</strong> - No debate here. He's a tactical genius and the best in the world. Any flaws in this team can't be blamed on him.

•   <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>#13 Marcus Bettinelli (ENG): 3/10</strong> - A pure backup. Wouldn't trust him in a crucial game.
•   <strong>#18 Stefan Ortega (GER): 6/10</strong> - Decent backup, but lacks the quality of a top-tier starter. Gets the job done.
•   <strong>#31 Ederson (BRA): 7/10</strong> - A solid shot-stopper and good with his feet, but prone to errors. Can be a liability in high-pressure situations.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>#3 Rúben Dias (POR): 8/10</strong> - A rock at the back. Commanding presence and excellent leadership.
•   <strong>#5 John Stones (ENG): 7/10</strong> - Good on the ball and a decent defender, but can be inconsistent.
•   <strong>#6 Nathan Aké (NED): 7/10</strong> - Versatile and reliable. A good squad player.
•   <strong>#21 Rayan Aït-Nouri (ALG): 6/10</strong> - Has potential, but still raw. Needs to improve defensively.
•   <strong>#22 Vitor Reis (BRA): 5/10</strong> - Young and unproven. A gamble.
•   <strong>#24 Joško Gvardiol (CRO): 7/10</strong> - Talented, but inconsistent. Needs to find his place in the team.
•   <strong>#25 Manuel Akanji (SUI): 6/10</strong> - A decent defender, but lacks the quality to be a regular starter.
•   <strong>#45 Abdukodir Khusanov (UZB): 4/10</strong> - A complete unknown. Probably not ready for this level.
•   <strong>#82 Rico Lewis (ENG): 6/10</strong> - Promising youngster, but still needs to develop physically and defensively.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>#4 Tijjani Reijnders (NED): 6/10</strong> - A good passer, but lacks the physicality and defensive awareness needed in midfield.
•   <strong>#11 Jérémy Doku (BEL): 7/10</strong> - Exciting winger with pace and skill, but needs to improve his decision-making.
•   <strong>#14 Nico González (ESP): 5/10</strong> - Decent technical ability, but lacks the dynamism to make a real impact.
•   <strong>#16 Rodri (ESP): 9/10</strong> - The backbone of the team. Excellent defensively and a great passer. Absolutely crucial.
•   <strong>#19 İlkay Gündoğan (GER): 8/10</strong> - Intelligent and versatile. A key player in midfield.
•   <strong>#20 Bernardo Silva (POR): 8/10</strong> - Creative and hard-working. A joy to watch.
•   <strong>#26 Savinho (BRA): 6/10</strong> - Talented, but inconsistent. Needs to bulk up and become more physical.
•   <strong>#27 Matheus Nunes (POR): 6/10</strong> - Energetic and skillful, but needs to improve his decision-making.
•   <strong>#29 Rayan Cherki (FRA): 6/10</strong> - Creative and skillful, but lacks the physicality and defensive awareness needed in midfield.
•   <strong>#30 Claudio Echeverri (ARG): 5/10</strong> - Young and unproven. Needs to bulk up and become more physical.
•   <strong>#47 Phil Foden (ENG): 9/10</strong> - A star in the making. Can play anywhere in attack and is a constant threat.
•   <strong>#52 Oscar Bobb (NOR): 6/10</strong> - Promising youngster, but still needs to develop physically and technically.
•   <strong>#75 Nico O'Reilly (ENG): 4/10</strong> - Not good enough for this level. Lacks the quality to make a real impact.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>#7 Omar Marmoush (EGY): 5/10</strong> - Lacks the quality to make a real impact.
•   <strong>#9 Erling Haaland (NOR): 10/10</strong> - A goal machine. Absolutely ruthless in front of goal.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7/10</strong>

This squad has some serious strengths, mainly in attack and midfield. However, the defense is suspect and the goalkeeping is inconsistent. There are also too many unproven youngsters and squad players who wouldn't start for other top teams.

<strong>League Performance:</strong>

•   <strong>Champions League:</strong> They are not winning with this squad if the defense does not work very hard.

•   <strong>Europa League:</strong> Would be one of the favorites, but not a guaranteed winner. The defense could let them down against top opposition.

•   <strong>Conference League:</strong> Would win comfortably. The quality is far too high for this competition.</div>
