  <h1>Description for 10.png, 13.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Armenia 3 - 0 Azerbaijan

Armenia's team is way more skilled and has way more professional players. Azerbaijan has only 3 of their players playing outside of Azerbaijan and they're not even at a super high level. On the other hand, Armenia has plenty of players playing at high-level clubs in Europe. The teams' all-time stats against each other also imply that Armenia will win. This is further exacerbated by the home advantage. I expect Armenia to dominate this game and win by at least 3 goals. I won't be surprised if Mkhitaryan bags a goal or two. He's still got it.</div>
