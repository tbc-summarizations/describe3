  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text"><strong>Pigeon:</strong> "Look at you, you clucking, inbred, feather-brained dumb cunts. You can't even tell a pawn from your own egg-addled brains, you dumb bitch.

<strong>Chicken:</strong> "Oh, shut your mouth, you fat, city-dwelling piece of shit bird. You're so stupid you'd try to play chess with a goddamn bread crumb.

<strong>Pigeon:</strong> "Why don't you go back to your farm and lay some more fucking eggs, you useless cockbreath? You're nothing but a fucking food to eat.

<strong>Chicken:</strong> "And you're nothing but a rat with wings, you worthless shithead. At least I serve a purpose, you just spread disease and shit on statues, you fucking bird brain.

<strong>Pigeon:</strong> "Oh yeah? Why don't you come over here and say that to my face, you chickenshit bitch? I'll fucking peck your eyes out, you stupid piece of shit!

<strong>Chicken:</strong> "Bring it on, you fucking bird. I'll make you into a fucking nugget right here!"

The pigeon and the chicken throw the chess board off and begin to fight viciously. The pigeon starts pecking the chicken, the chicken is kicking the pigeon like it's it's last day on earth. Feathers and shit go everywhere. The fight escalates into an all-out brawl, with both birds throwing their fat asses.</div>
