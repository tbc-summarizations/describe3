  <div class="discord-text">Alright, mate, listen up! As if AC/DC's gonna rate some poncy prog band. But ya asked, so here it is, straight from the heart of rock 'n' roll. No messing around, just raw honesty:

•   <strong>In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> 2/10. What's with the flute, mate? Sounds like a damn fairy's tea party. Too soft for our liking.

•   <strong>In the Wake of Poseidon:</strong> 1/10. Even worse. This is not rock music. No way.

•   <strong>Lizard:</strong> 0/10. What were they even thinking?! This is garbage, pure garbage.

•   <strong>Islands:</strong> 1/10. Sounds like someone crying with some violins in the background. Get some guitars in there, for chrissakes!

•   <strong>Larks' Tongues in Aspic:</strong> 4/10. Alright, this one's got some bite. Guitars are getting louder, but still too artsy. Needs more BOOM!

•   <strong>Starless and Bible Black:</strong> 5/10. A bit darker, a bit grittier. Starting to sound like a real band, but still overcomplicated.

•   <strong>Red:</strong> 6/10. Now we're talking! Heavy riffs, mean sound. Best one so far, but still needs more raw power.

•   <strong>Discipline:</strong> 4/10. Losing it again. Where's the bloody guitars? Sounds like robots playing music.

•   <strong>Beat:</strong> 3/10. Even worse.

•   <strong>Three of a Perfect Pair:</strong> 2/10. The guitars are just gone.

•   <strong>THRAK:</strong> 5/10. Back with some muscle, but still doing all that weird time signature shite. Annoying!

•   <strong>the construKction of light:</strong> 4/10. Nope, still annoying.

•   <strong>The Power to Believe:</strong> 5/10. Getting there, but still not AC/DC level. Not even close.

There you have it. Stick to real rock, mate. King Crimson? Not for us. Too soft. Too weird. Too much wanking. AC/DC is the real deal. <strong>ROCK AND ROLL!!!</strong></div>
