  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this physics problem. Here's how to solve it:

<strong>Understanding the Problem</strong>

•   <strong>MRUV:</strong> The bus is undergoing Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (MRUV). This means it has constant acceleration.
•   <strong>Initial Conditions:</strong> The bus starts from rest (v = 0).
•   <strong>First Phase:</strong> The bus enters the tunnel completely in 2 seconds. During this time, the front of the bus travels a distance equal to the length of the tunnel (L).
•   <strong>Second Phase:</strong> We need to find the additional time it takes for the bus to <em>completely exit</em> the tunnel.  This means the <em>back</em> of the bus needs to travel the length of the tunnel (L) plus the length of the bus (6m) in addition to whatever distance the front of the bus travels.
•   <strong>Final Velocity:</strong> The bus has a velocity of 10 m/s when it completely exits the tunnel.

<strong>Steps to Solve</strong>

1.  <strong>Analyze the First Phase (Entering the Tunnel):</strong>
•   Let 'a' be the constant acceleration of the bus.
•   We know that the distance traveled by the front of the bus (L) in time t = 2 s is given by:
        L = v₀t + (1/2)at²  Since v₀ = 0,  L = (1/2)a(2)² = 2a
        Therefore, L = 2a
2.  <strong>Analyze the Second Phase (Exiting the Tunnel):</strong>
•   Let 't' be the additional time it takes to completely exit the tunnel.
•   During this time 't', the <em>back</em> of the bus needs to travel a distance of L + 6 meters.
•   The initial velocity for this second phase is the velocity the bus has after 2 seconds, which can be calculated as:
        v = v₀ + at = 0 + a(2) = 2a
•   Now, using the equation of motion for the back of the bus:
        L + 6 = (2a)t + (1/2)at²
•   We know L = 2a, so:
        2a + 6 = 2at + (1/2)at²
3.  <strong>Relate the Total Velocity (10 m/s):</strong>
•   The final velocity of the <em>front</em> of the bus when it completely exits the tunnel is 10 m/s.  This velocity is reached after a total time of 2 + t seconds.
•   Using the equation: v = v₀ + at  --&gt;  10 = 0 + a(2 + t)  --&gt;  a = 10 / (2 + t)

4.  <strong>Solve the Equations:</strong>
•   Substitute the value of 'a' from step 3 into the equation from step 2:
        2 <em> [10 / (2 + t)] + 6 = 2 </em> [10 / (2 + t)] <em> t + (1/2) </em> [10 / (2 + t)] <em> t²
•   Simplify and solve for 't':
        20 / (2 + t) + 6 = 20t / (2 + t) + 5t² / (2 + t)
        Multiply both sides by (2 + t):
        20 + 6(2 + t) = 20t + 5t²
        20 + 12 + 6t = 20t + 5t²
        5t² + 14t - 32 = 0

5.  <strong>Solve the Quadratic:</strong>
•   Use the quadratic formula to solve for 't':
        t = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
        t = [-14 ± sqrt(14² - 4 </em> 5 <em> -32)] / (2 </em> 5)
        t = [-14 ± sqrt(196 + 640)] / 10
        t = [-14 ± sqrt(836)] / 10
        t = [-14 ± 28.91] / 10
•   We get two possible values for 't':
        t₁ = (-14 + 28.91) / 10 = 1.491 seconds
        t₂ = (-14 - 28.91) / 10 = -4.291 seconds
•   Since time cannot be negative, we discard t₂.

<strong>Answer</strong>

Therefore, the additional time it takes for the bus to completely exit the tunnel is approximately <strong>1.49 seconds</strong>.</div>
