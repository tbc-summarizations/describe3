  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutal and honest assessment of Swiss football clubs based on their overall impact, history, current form, and potential:

•   <strong>Basel: 9/10</strong> - Historically dominant and still a force. Their youth academy is top-notch, and they usually compete in Europe. They've had dips in form, but their potential is still massive.

•   <strong>Grasshopper Club Zurich: 4/10</strong> - Once a powerhouse, now a shadow of their former glory. Their recent performances have been lackluster, and they need a major overhaul to return to the top.

•   <strong>Lausanne-Sport: 3/10</strong> - A yo-yo club. Some flashes of brilliance, but generally inconsistent.

•   <strong>Lugano: 6/10</strong> - They've been steadily improving, becoming a solid mid-table team that can occasionally challenge for European spots.

•   <strong>Luzern: 5/10</strong> - Can be exciting at times, but their consistency is their biggest problem. They're good for an upset, but not much else.

•   <strong>Servette: 7/10</strong> - Historically significant and back on the rise. They have the potential to become a consistent top-four team.

•   <strong>Sion: 2/10</strong> - Chaotic and mismanaged. Too much drama, not enough football.

•   <strong>St. Gallen: 6/10</strong> - Their fans are passionate and create a great atmosphere, but the team often falls short. They need investment and a better strategy to compete consistently.

•   <strong>Winterthur: 3/10</strong> - A small club, generally fighting relegation. They lack the resources and quality to challenge the top teams.

•   <strong>Young Boys: 10/10</strong> - The current kings of Swiss football. Dominant, well-run, and with a clear vision.

•   <strong>Yverdon-Sport: 2/10</strong> - Newly promoted, they'll likely struggle to stay in the league.

•   <strong>Zurich: 7/10</strong> - They have a big fanbase and the potential to be a top team, but they need more consistency and better management.</div>
