  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's have a go at this musical tomfoolery. As a fella from the 1940s, I'll give you my straight-shootin' opinions on these here "albums":

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> What in the name of Glenn Miller is this racket? Sounds like a broken music box being tortured by gremlins. 0/10

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust...:</strong> Some fella dressin' up like a dame from Mars? The war must have done somethin' to folks' heads. It's bizarre, and I don't care for it. 2/10

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists...:</strong> This ain't music, it's noise. Sounds like the factory where I work, but less rhythmic. 1/10

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> Well, this is just depressing. No thanks. 0/10

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> A young fella with a powerful voice, can't deny that. But the songs are a bit too dramatic for my taste. Give me Sinatra any day. 6/10

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> What in the blazes is this? The language is crude, and the "music" is just a bunch of clatter. 0/10

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> This is too progressive and bizarre for me. Too much free form nonsense. 3/10

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> A bit jazzy, but the lyrics are all over the place. This would never do. 4/10

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> Nonsensical dribble from a couple of hoodlums. 0/10

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> Too political, and the music is alright but ultimately boring. 5/10

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> Too jazzy for my taste. 3/10

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> Not a huge fan of the subject matter, but I will say that the music is quite good for what it is. 6/10

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> This is alright. Some strange musical ideas here, but they're good. 6/10

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> Good music, but Prince is no Duke Ellington. 6/10

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> Too many electronics for my liking. 2/10

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> The boy's got talent, I'll give him that. A bit too sentimental for my taste, but not bad. 7/10

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> This is just noise! Sounds like someone's attacking my ears with a rusty pipe. 0/10

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> These fellas have some catchy tunes, I'll give them that. A bit too long-haired for my liking, but the music is pleasant enough. 7/10

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> What is this? This is pure trash. 0/10

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> Absolute garbage. This is an assault on the ears. 0/10</div>
