  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the Athletic Bilbao logo:

<strong>Rating: 3/10</strong>

<strong>Detailed Breakdown:</strong>

•   <strong>Overall Impression:</strong> It looks incredibly outdated and amateurish. Like something slapped together in MS Paint in the early 90s.

•   <strong>Shape:</strong> The shield shape is generic and uninspired.

•   <strong>Imagery:</strong>
•   The bridge and church imagery might have local significance, but visually they're just muddy and lack detail. The execution is so poor they look like clip art.
•   The red and white stripes are iconic for the club, but their implementation is boring.

•   <strong>Typography:</strong>
•   The "ATHLETIC CLUB" text is just jammed at the top and awkwardly spaced.
•   "BILBAO" at the bottom is marginally better, but still feels like an afterthought.
•   Those "X" elements are completely baffling. What do they even represent? They just add unnecessary visual clutter.

•   <strong>Color Palette:</strong> The red, white, and black are fine, but they do nothing to elevate the design. It's a missed opportunity.

<strong>Overall:</strong> The Athletic Bilbao logo screams for a complete overhaul. It lacks visual appeal and doesn't represent the club in a modern or compelling way. It's stuck in the past and needs a serious update to compete with other top clubs.</div>
