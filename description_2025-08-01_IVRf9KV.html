  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal truth about these Europa League qualifying matches:

•   <strong>Lugano 0-1 CFR Cluj:</strong> Lugano, you bottled it. A Swiss team losing to a Romanian side? Embarrassing. Cluj, good job grinding out a win, even if it was only by a single goal. Don't get complacent, though.

•   <strong>Celje 2-3 AEK Larnaca:</strong> Celje, you're a Slovenian team, not exactly a footballing powerhouse, but still, losing to AEK Larnaca isn't a good look. Larnaca, solid win, keep the momentum going.

•   <strong>Levski Sofia 0-1 Braga:</strong> Levski, playing like a bunch of amateurs. Braga, you did what you had to do, but don't let your performance drop in the next round.

•   <strong>Baník Ostrava 3-4 Legia Warsaw:</strong> Baník Ostrava, you almost pulled off a comeback, but close only counts in horseshoes. Legia, lucky escape, tighten up your defense.

•   <strong>Anderlecht 2-2 Häcken (Häcken wins 4-2 on penalties):</strong> Anderlecht, what a disgrace! A team with your history losing to Häcken on penalties? Unacceptable. Häcken, well done on the victory, but don't get too cocky.

•   <strong>Sheriff Tiraspol 2-7 Utrecht:</strong> Sheriff, you got absolutely demolished. Time for a serious rebuild. Utrecht, dominant performance, keep up the intensity.

•   <strong>Midtjylland 3-2 Hibernian:</strong> Midtjylland, you scraped by. Hibernian, tough loss, but you put up a fight.

•   <strong>Beşiktaş 2-6 Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> Beşiktaş, utterly pathetic. Shakhtar Donetsk, clinical and ruthless, a statement win.</div>
