  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to give you the cold, hard truth about these teams' chances.

<strong>Nice ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·: 30%</strong>

Nice are a team that have talent, but they have too many question marks and are not consistent enough. The French league is getting more competitive, and they were a mid-table team last season for a reason. They'll need a lot of luck and a very favorable draw to make it through. Don't hold your breath.

<strong>Feyenoord ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±: 65%</strong>

Feyenoord are probably the best team out of the bunch, but still not as strong as the best. Feyenoord are the Dutch champions, and that's nothing to sneeze at. They have a decent squad. However, the Dutch league isn't exactly a powerhouse. Their biggest problem is they're likely to get picked apart by bigger clubs looking for talent. But they have a good shot, they have a pretty decent shot if they stay with this team, they should be in the group stages

<strong>Benfica ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹: 75%</strong>

Benfica are the favorites here. They are usually in this tournament. They sell all their players but remain competitive and almost always win their League. They do well in the UCL almost all the time as well. 

<strong>Club Brugge ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª: 50%</strong>

Club Brugge are a decent team, but I don't see much happening this season. The Belgian league is a massive level under the top 5 leagues in Europe. So it's a good start and they usually are competitive but they can't make it far in the UCL in their current state.

<strong>FenerbahÃ§e ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·: 40%</strong>

FenerbahÃ§e are Turkey's big boys, but they never really seem to deliver on the European stage. The Turkish league is often chaotic, and they're never consistent enough to string together quality performances. They have a chance, but I wouldn't bet on them.</div>
