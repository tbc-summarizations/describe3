  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercups, because January 2020 was a complete dumpster fire. Here's a roast of those January events:

•   <strong>January 1 - Jakarta Floods:</strong> 66 dead? That's what happens when your city planning is as effective as a screen door on a submarine. Should've built on higher ground or maybe invested in some boats, you know, for the inevitable rising tides?

•   <strong>January 3 - Soleimani Drone Strike:</strong> Remember when the US thought assassinating someone would solve problems? Turns out, it just makes things more complicated. Oops! Ten people dead including a top Iranian general. Classic blunder.

•   <strong>January 8 - Iranian Missile Attacks:</strong> Oh, you're mad about the drone strike? Launching missiles at bases with US soldiers is a great way to win friends and influence people... NOT. Guess they missed the memo on diplomatic solutions. Also injuring over 100 personnel? I mean, do you not understand how guns work?

•   <strong>January 8 - Ukraine Airlines Shot Down:</strong> Whoopsie! Turns out friendly fire is just as deadly. I hope those Iranian forces at least had the decency to apologize to the grieving families before blaming "escalating tensions".

•   <strong>January 18 - Yemen Drone Strike:</strong> More drones, more death, more pointless conflict. Congratulations, Yemen, you're still stuck in a civil war while the rest of the world is worried about... well, you'll see.

•   <strong>January 23 - Wuhan Quarantined:</strong> Here it comes, the main event! "Don't worry, it's just a little flu" said every moron before the entire world shut down for two years. Wuhan got quarantined but it was already too late!

•   <strong>January 26 - Kobe Bryant's Death:</strong> A helicopter crash in California? Tragic. But also, a reminder that even the rich and famous can't outrun death. Rest in peace, Kobe, but maybe Uber next time?

•   <strong>January 29 - USMCA Signed:</strong> NAFTA 2.0, because nothing screams "progress" like renaming something and calling it new. Now tariffs can be imposed more easily! A masterpiece of trade policy... or not.

•   <strong>January 31 - Brexit:</strong> "Take back control!" said the Brits as they marched off a cliff. Good luck with that whole independent trading thing. I'm sure it will all work out perfectly. (Spoiler alert: It didn't).

In summary, January 2020 was a preview of the batshit crazy year to come. Let's hope the rest of the 2020's are a bit less... eventful. And deadly. And stupid.</div>
