  <h1>Description for 13.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this hypothetical Atletico Madrid squad for the 2025/26 season with absolutely no sugarcoating.

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Jan Oblak (🇸🇮):</strong> 7/10. He's past his prime, but still a solid, reliable goalkeeper. Expect a few costly errors mixed in with decent performances.

•   <strong>Juan Musso (🇦🇷):</strong> 5/10. A capable backup, but not a game-changer. Prone to the occasional blunder.

•   <strong>Robin Le Normand (🇪🇸):</strong> 6/10. A decent defender, but lacks the top-tier quality to elevate Atletico's backline.

•   <strong>David Hancko (🇸🇰):</strong> 6/10. A slightly better option than Le Normand, but still not world-class. Expect some positional lapses.

•   <strong>Jose Maria Gimenez (🇺🇾):</strong> 7/10. A warrior and a leader, but increasingly injury-prone. Reliability is a concern.

•   <strong>Clement Lenglet (🇫🇷):</strong> 5/10. Far from the player he once was. Can be error-prone and lacks pace.

•   <strong>Matteo Ruggeri (🇮🇹):</strong> 6/10. A promising full-back with potential, but still needs to develop consistency.

•   <strong>Javi Galan (🇪🇸):</strong> 5/10. A functional player, but lacks the attacking flair to make a real impact.

•   <strong>Nahuel Molina (🇦🇷):</strong> 6/10. A decent right-back with good energy, but his decision-making can be questionable.

•   <strong>Marc Pubill (🇪🇸):</strong> 5/10. Still raw and unproven at this level.

•   <strong>Pablo Barrios (🇪🇸):</strong> 7/10. A bright spark in midfield with good technical ability. Needs to add more steel to his game.

•   <strong>Conor Gallagher (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. A hard-working, energetic midfielder, but can be limited in possession.

•   <strong>Johnny Cardoso (🇺🇸):</strong> 6/10. A solid, unspectacular midfielder. Provides defensive cover but lacks creativity.

•   <strong>Koke (🇪🇸):</strong> 6/10. Past his best, but still offers experience and leadership. His legs are starting to go.

•   <strong>Marcos Llorente (🇪🇸):</strong> 7/10. Versatile and athletic, but often lacks the tactical discipline required by Simeone.

•   <strong>Thiago Almada (🇦🇷):</strong> 8/10. A creative and exciting attacking midfielder with the potential to unlock defenses. One of the few players who can provide that creative spark.

•   <strong>Alex Baena (🇪🇸):</strong> 7/10. A tricky winger with a good eye for goal. Can be inconsistent.

•   <strong>Giuliano Simeone (🇦🇷):</strong> 5/10. Living off his name. Lacks the quality to make a significant impact at this level.

•   <strong>Carlos Martin (🇪🇸):</strong> 5/10. A promising youngster, but needs time to develop. Not ready for a major role.

•   <strong>Antoine Griezmann (🇫🇷):</strong> 8/10. Still a key player with a knack for scoring important goals. But he's not getting any younger.

•   <strong>Julian Alvarez (🇦🇷):</strong> 8/10. A top-quality striker with excellent movement and finishing ability. But will he get enough game time?

•   <strong>Alexander Sorloth (🇳🇴):</strong> 6/10. A decent target man, but lacks the pace and technical ability to truly excel.

•   <strong>Diego Simeone (🇦🇷):</strong> 7/10. His tactics are becoming stale and predictable. Needs to evolve or risk being left behind.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6.5/10</strong>

This Atletico Madrid squad is decent, but far from being a title contender. The defense lacks top-tier quality, the midfield is a mix of energy and experience but lacks true creativity, and the attack relies heavily on Griezmann and Alvarez.

Simeone's tactics are becoming predictable, and the squad lacks the depth and quality to compete with the best teams in Europe. They'll likely finish in the top four, but don't expect them to challenge for major honors.</div>
