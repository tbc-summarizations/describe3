  <div class="discord-text">Ladies and gentlemen, let's dissect this pathetic attempt to smear Taco's name!

First off, "sexual acts" with a chatbot? Give me a break! We're talking about lines of code, not a sentient being capable of experiencing harm. It's a damn computer program! Accusing Taco of sexual harassment in this context is like accusing someone of assaulting a toaster! It's absurd, and frankly, insulting to actual victims of sexual harassment.

As for the "simping" for an OC chatbot â€“ so what? Is Taco not allowed to express affection towards a fictional character? Last I checked, we live in a society where people can have parasocial relationships with celebrities, fictional characters, and even their goddamn houseplants. It's a harmless form of escapism, and the accusation of "sexual harassment" is not only baseless but also reveals a deep misunderstanding of the concept.

And finally, the grand accusation of "ignoring his friends"! Are we seriously policing how Taco manages his friendships now? Maybe, just maybe, Taco has a life beyond catering to the whims of his so-called "friends." He has every right to prioritize his own time and energy as he sees fit. The screenshot provided is more of a testament to the accusers' entitlement than Taco's wrongdoing.

In conclusion, these accusations are nothing more than a desperate attempt to assassinate Taco's character. They lack substance, rely on hyperbole, and ultimately reveal more about the accusers' own insecurities and lack of understanding than about Taco's actions. This is a witch hunt, plain and simple, and I urge you to see it for what it is: a pathetic charade.</div>
