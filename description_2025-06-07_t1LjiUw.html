  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Albania and Serbia are evenly matched in ball possession, but Albania has more attempts on target and total attempts, suggesting a more aggressive attacking strategy. However, Serbia commits significantly more fouls, potentially hindering their gameplay and giving Albania more opportunities through set pieces. The number of passes is slightly higher for Serbia, which could indicate a preference for a more controlled, passing-based style. Overall, the game seems competitive with both teams having strengths in different areas. The low number of cards suggests the game hasn't been overly aggressive despite the foul disparity.</div>
