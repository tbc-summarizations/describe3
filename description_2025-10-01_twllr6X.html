  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here's my brutally honest rating of each song on that list:

•   <strong>Pharoah Sanders - The Creator Has a Master Plan:</strong> 9/10. A spiritual jazz masterpiece. Expansive and deeply moving. Not for the faint of heart, but incredibly rewarding.

•   <strong>Swans - The Glowing Man:</strong> 7/10. A behemoth of a track. Requires commitment to get through, but has moments of sheer catharsis. Can be a bit repetitive at times.

•   <strong>Swans - Cloud of Unknowing:</strong> 5/10. Atmospheric, but lacks the punch of their better work. Feels a bit meandering.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Sleep:</strong> 8/10. A classic of the post-rock genre. Builds tension expertly and has a satisfying payoff. Can be a bit melodramatic.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Static:</strong> 8/10. Just like Sleep, GYBE! Is a masterpiece.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Storm:</strong> 8/10. Just like Sleep, GYBE! Is a masterpiece.

•   <strong>Swans - Frankie M:</strong> 3/10. One of the worst songs I have ever listened to.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Like Antennas to Heaven...:</strong> 7/10. Similar to "Sleep," but slightly less impactful in my opinion. Still a solid piece of post-rock.

•   <strong>Mingus - Track D:</strong> 6/10. Mingus is brilliant, but this track doesn't fully grab me. Interesting ideas, but not his most memorable work.

•   <strong>John Coltrane - Part III - Pursuance / IV - Psalm:</strong> 10/10. A transcendental experience. Coltrane at his peak, pushing the boundaries of jazz. Essential listening.

•   <strong>Joanna Newsom - Only Skin:</strong> 9/10. A sprawling, poetic epic. Newsom's lyrics and harp playing are captivating. Demands your full attention.

•   <strong>Car Seat Headrest - Famous Prophets (Stars):</strong> 7/10. A sprawling indie rock track with some great moments. Can feel a bit unfocused at times.

•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Voodoo Chile:</strong> 8/10. Raw, bluesy, and electrifying. Hendrix at his most visceral.

•   <strong>Swans - The World Looks Red / The World Looks Black:</strong> 4/10. A lesser-known Swans track that doesn't quite hit the mark. Feels a bit underdeveloped.

•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - 1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be):</strong> 7/10. Atmospheric and psychedelic. A bit long, but has some beautiful moments.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5):</strong> 10/10. A timeless classic. Haunting, majestic, and perfectly crafted.

•   <strong>Car Seat Headrest - Beach Life-In-Death:</strong> 8/10. A fan favorite. Quirky, angsty, and undeniably catchy.

•   <strong>Swans - Cloud of Forgetting:</strong> 5/10. A lesser-known Swans track that doesn't quite hit the mark. Feels a bit underdeveloped.

•   <strong>Kanye West - Last Call:</strong> 6/10. Overrated as a song.

•   <strong>Black Country, New Road - Basketball Shoes:</strong> 7/10. Overrated and boring.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (6-9):</strong> 10/10. A timeless classic. Haunting, majestic, and perfectly crafted.

•   <strong>King Crimson - Moonchild:</strong> 3/10. A snoozefest.

•   <strong>Joanna Newsom - Emily:</strong> 10/10. A sprawling, poetic epic. Newsom's lyrics and harp playing are captivating. Demands your full attention.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - Mortal Man:</strong> 8/10. Great concept, great execution, but drags on for too long.

•   <strong>Miles Davis - All Blues:</strong> 10/10. One of the greatest jazz songs of all time. Effortless cool and endlessly listenable.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Earthmover:</strong> 6/10. Not my type of music at all, not sure what the hype is all about.

•   <strong>Bob Dylan - Desolation Row:</strong> 8/10. A lyrical masterpiece. Dylan at his most enigmatic and poetic.

•   <strong>Racionais MC's - Tô Ouvindo Alguém Me Chamar:</strong> 7/10. Decent lyrics, but the melody does not match up to my personal preference.

•   <strong>Racionais MC's - Fórmula Mágica da Paz:</strong> 7/10. Decent lyrics, but the melody does not match up to my personal preference.

•   <strong>Daft Punk - Too Long:</strong> 9/10. A hypnotic, dance-floor banger. Daft Punk at their most infectious.

•   <strong>Earl Sweatshirt - solace:</strong> 6/10. I hate this song.

There you have it. Brutally honest, as requested. Take it or leave it.</div>
