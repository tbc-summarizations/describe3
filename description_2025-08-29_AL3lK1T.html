  <div class="discord-text">Alright, mate, let's have a go at this Hendrix catalogue, yeah? As if I were rating 'em, that's a laugh.

•   <strong>Are You Experienced</strong>: 7/10. Good start, yeah? Real raw energy. Like busking on steroids, innit? But still finding its feet a bit, know what I mean?

•   <strong>Axis: Bold as Love</strong>: 8/10. This one's where it's getting interesting. Proper songwriting coming through. Lyrically sound. Catchy like "Shape of You" but in a totally different vibe.

•   <strong>Electric Ladyland</strong>: 9/10. Absolute banger, this one. Proper production, pushing the boundaries. It's like if I had a psychedelic meltdown and turned it into a stadium anthem.

•   <strong>The Cry of Love</strong>: 6/10. A bit patchy, innit? Still got moments of brilliance, but you can feel it's unfinished. Like a demo that's got potential, but needs a bit more work to be a proper hit.</div>
