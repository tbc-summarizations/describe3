  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect Astana's Champions League campaign with the brutal honesty you demanded.

<strong>Match Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Juventus 1-1 Astana:</strong> A lucky draw. Juventus probably underestimated them. Solid defensive performance, but the goal was more of a fluke. <strong>4/10.</strong>
•   <strong>Astana 1-0 Marseille:</strong> Decent result, capitalizing on Marseille's typical European away day collapse. Still, nothing to write home about; winning a home game against an out-of-form opponent is the bare minimum. <strong>5/10.</strong>
•   <strong>Manchester City 2-2 Astana:</strong> A shocking result, especially away from home. Points for tactical discipline and exploiting City's defensive vulnerabilities. <strong>8/10.</strong>
•   <strong>Astana 1-1 RB Leipzig:</strong> Another draw is a fine result, but Leipzig was in shambles at the time. Not bad, not good. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Benfica 3-1 Astana:</strong> A predictable loss. The scoreline reflects the gulf in quality. Zero tactical response to Benfica's attacking threat. <strong>2/10.</strong>
•   <strong>Astana 1-1 Olympiacos:</strong> A draw is respectable, but failing to secure a win against a struggling Olympiacos at home is pathetic. Lack of ambition. <strong>3/10.</strong>

<strong>Overall Campaign Rating: 4/10</strong>

Astana's campaign was largely unremarkable. They had a few surprising results, particularly the draw against Manchester City, which inflated their overall perception. But, considering the level of competition in the Champions League, their performances were mostly mediocre. They played defensively, relying on luck and the opponent's mistakes rather than demonstrating any true attacking prowess. They only had 7 points which is not really anything to be that proud of, let's be serious. Eliminated is eliminated, no point of trying to get the most out of it, it is just what it is.</div>
