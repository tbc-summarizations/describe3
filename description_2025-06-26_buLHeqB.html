  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rating of those Italian clubs, in my opinion:

•   <strong>Atalanta:</strong> 7/10. Consistently punching above their weight. Their recent run under Gasperini has been impressive. They play exciting football.
•   <strong>Bologna:</strong> 5/10. Can be entertaining at times, but far from consistent. Never really challenge for anything significant.
•   <strong>Cagliari:</strong> 4/10. Struggle to stay in Serie A. Often a yo-yo club.
•   <strong>Como:</strong> 3/10. They are in Serie B and have a long way to prove themselves.
•   <strong>Empoli:</strong> 5/10. Often play attractive football for a smaller team, but their results are inconsistent. A selling club.
•   <strong>Fiorentina:</strong> 6/10. Potential for greatness but often underachieve.
•   <strong>Genoa:</strong> 4/10. Historic club but often in turmoil. Struggle to compete in Serie A.
•   <strong>Hellas Verona:</strong> 5/10. Decent for a small team.
•   <strong>Inter Milan:</strong> 9/10. One of the giants. Always competing for the title. History, great players, and financial power.
•   <strong>Juventus:</strong> 9/10. Despite recent issues, they are the most dominant team in Italian football history. Still a force to be reckoned with.
•   <strong>Lazio:</strong> 7/10. Can challenge for European spots but are inconsistent.
•   <strong>Lecce:</strong> 4/10. Often in Serie B and are in turmoil and have little to no budget.
•   <strong>Milan:</strong> 9/10. One of the most successful clubs in Europe. Always in the hunt for major trophies.
•   <strong>Monza:</strong> 5/10. Can be entertaining.
•   <strong>Napoli:</strong> 8/10. Scudetto last season will be hard to repeat, but a really likeable and dangerous team.
•   <strong>Parma:</strong> 5/10. Have a good fan base but struggle to be relevant.
•   <strong>Roma:</strong> 8/10. Big club with a passionate fanbase. Underachieve a lot.
•   <strong>Torino:</strong> 5/10. Mid-table mediocrity is their usual level. Not much excitement.
•   <strong>Udinese:</strong> 5/10. Known for developing young talent, but never truly competitive.
•   <strong>Venezia:</strong> 3/10. Struggle to stay in Serie A. Often a yo-yo club.</div>
