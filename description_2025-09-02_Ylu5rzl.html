  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest rating of this hypothetical Premier League Most Valuable XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: David Raya (Arsenal) - 5/10:</strong>
    He's alright but is far from a top-tier Premier League keeper. His distribution is a major liability, and he lacks the commanding presence required for a truly elite team.

•   <strong>Defender: Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City) - 7/10:</strong>
    A solid defender with good potential, but overpriced and not quite living up to the hype. His tackling can be erratic, and he sometimes gets caught out of position.

•   <strong>Defender: Gabriel Magalhães (Arsenal) - 6/10:</strong>
    A decent defender, but prone to errors and lapses in concentration. He lacks the composure and technical ability of the truly great center-backs.

•   <strong>Defender: William Saliba (Arsenal) - 8/10:</strong>
    Arsenal's best defender and he seems really promising. Still needs more time to prove himself though.

•   <strong>Defender: Jurrien Timber (Arsenal) - 4/10:</strong>
    A decent defender at best, and I'm not convinced he's anything special.

•   <strong>Defensive Midfielder: Rodri (Manchester City) - 9/10:</strong>
    A world-class defensive midfielder. Rodri is a beast in midfield. He's the glue that holds City's midfield together.

•   <strong>Defensive Midfielder: Declan Rice (Arsenal) - 7/10:</strong>
    A solid defensive midfielder. An absolute powerhouse, but still has limitations in his passing range.

•   <strong>Attacking Midfielder: Cody Gakpo (Liverpool) - 5/10:</strong>
    Overrated and inconsistent. He lacks the creativity and vision to be a truly effective attacking midfielder.

•   <strong>Attacking Midfielder: Florian Wirtz (Liverpool) - 6/10:</strong>
    A promising youngster, but still raw and unproven. He needs to develop his consistency and decision-making.

•   <strong>Attacking Midfielder: Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) - 9/10:</strong>
    One of Arsenal's best and consistent players. He is lethal in front of the goal, which makes him the top tier player he is.

•   <strong>Attacker: Erling Haaland (Manchester City) - 10/10:</strong>
    A goal-scoring machine. Haaland is a physical specimen with incredible pace and power.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6/10</strong>

This team has some real talent but it also is flawed. Raya and Gabriel would absolutely let the team down on crucial occasions. The midfield has a good balance of steel and creativity, but the attack is far too reliant on Haaland. Overall, this team would struggle against the best in Europe and would likely fall short in the Premier League title race.</div>
