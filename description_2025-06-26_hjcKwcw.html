  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic excuse for a group in the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League D.

<strong>Overall Impression:</strong> This group is a joke. San Marino, Gibraltar, and Liechtenstein – a collection of teams where mediocrity is celebrated. The fact that any of these teams are even participating in a competition with the UEFA banner is insulting to football.

<strong>Group Standings Analysis:</strong>

1.  <strong>San Marino (Promoted to League C):</strong> Congratulations, San Marino, you managed to stumble your way to the top of the pile of garbage. Two wins, one draw, and one loss. I'm sure the entire nation is throwing a parade. Let's be real though, you got lucky. Let's see how you do against some real teams.
2.  <strong>Gibraltar (Qualified to the Promotion Play-offs):</strong> Oh, Gibraltar, you almost had it. One win, three draws. You couldn't even manage a single victory against San Marino or Liechtenstein. Pathetic. Good luck in the play-offs, you'll need it.
3.  <strong>Liechtenstein (Stays in League D):</strong> Liechtenstein, you are an embarrassment to football. Zero wins, two draws, two losses. Your only goal is to lose so bad that the other teams don't even enjoy beating you. You are the basement of the basement. Just disband the national team, you're wasting everyone's time.

<strong>Matchday Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Matchday 1:</strong>
•   San Marino 1-0 Liechtenstein: San Marino managed to win against the worst national team in Europe, so did they really win? Is there a negative win?
•   Gibraltar 2-2 Liechtenstein: Gibraltar and Liechtenstein managed a draw. A draw! Congrats on being worse than your opponents.
•   <strong>Matchday 2:</strong>
•   Gibraltar 1-0 San Marino: Gibraltar somehow defeated San Marino. Is San Marino not even a good minnow team.
•   Liechtenstein 0-0 Gibraltar: So Gibraltar can win against San Marino but tie against Liechtenstein? What a joke.
•   <strong>Matchday 3:</strong>
•   San Marino 1-1 Gibraltar: San Marino could not even beat Gibraltar after losing to them.
•   Liechtenstein 1-3 San Marino: Pathetic showing from Liechtenstein. San Marino is barely a team, and even they were able to score 3 times.

<strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> This group is an insult to football, and that is me being nice. I hope to see one of the teams get relegated. Also Liechtenstein should just shut down the national team.</div>
