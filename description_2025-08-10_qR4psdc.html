  <h1>Description for 124.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Rangers squad for 2025/26. I'll give you my brutally honest assessment, player by player and then overall:

<strong>Manager:</strong>

•   <strong>Russell Martin:</strong> 5/10 - He's tactically naive and too idealistic to compete at this level. He lacks the killer instinct needed to win consistently.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Jack Butland:</strong> 7/10 - A decent shot-stopper, but his distribution is a liability.
•   <strong>Liam Kelly:</strong> 5/10 - A backup who will get exposed against better opposition.
•   <strong>Kieran Wright:</strong> 3/10 - Not good enough for this level.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Nasser Djiga:</strong> 6/10 - Raw potential, but prone to mistakes.
•   <strong>John Souttar:</strong> 6/10 - Injury-prone and lacks pace.
•   <strong>Ben Davies:</strong> 5/10 - Too slow and often makes poor decisions.
•   <strong>Leon King:</strong> 7/10 - Promising but needs more experience.
•   <strong>Clinton Nsiala:</strong> 4/10 - Another defender who is not good enough.
•   <strong>Emmanuel Fernandez:</strong> 3/10 - Clearly not a starting eleven quality defender.
•   <strong>Jefté:</strong> 6/10 - An average defender.
•   <strong>Ridvan Yilmaz:</strong> 7/10 - Good going forward but defensively suspect.
•   <strong>Robbie Fraser:</strong> 4/10 - Unlikely to make the grade.
•   <strong>Max Aarons:</strong> 7/10 - A consistent and solid defender.
•   <strong>Dujon Sterling:</strong> 6/10 - A backup defender.
•   <strong>James Tavernier:</strong> 6/10 - Has been a club legend, but is not consistent enough.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Bailey Rice:</strong> 6/10 - Decent talent but needs to develop more physically.
•   <strong>Nicolas Raskin:</strong> 7/10 - Tenacious but lacks creativity.
•   <strong>Mohamed Diomande:</strong> 6/10 - Not a world beater.
•   <strong>Jose Cifuentes:</strong> 6/10 - A back up midfielder.
•   <strong>Connor Barron:</strong> 7/10 - Solid box to box midfielder with huge potential.
•   <strong>Joe Rothwell:</strong> 5/10 - A backup option who is not good enough.
•   <strong>Nedim Bajrami:</strong> 6/10 - He does not produce goals or assists.
•   <strong>Thelo Aasgaard:</strong> 7/10 - Has potential and offers something different.
•   <strong>Lyall Cameron:</strong> 5/10 - Another one who is not good enough.
•   <strong>Kieran Dowell:</strong> 6/10 - An average player.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Mikey Moore:</strong> 6/10 - Young and raw.
•   <strong>Oscar Cortes:</strong> 8/10 - A good quality winger.
•   <strong>Djeidi Gassama:</strong> 6/10 - Inconsistent.
•   <strong>Oliver Antman:</strong> 5/10 - Does not offer enough.
•   <strong>Rabbi Matondo:</strong> 6/10 - Too inconsistent.
•   <strong>Hamza Igamane:</strong> 5/10 - Not good enough.
•   <strong>Cyriel Dessers:</strong> 4/10 - A donkey of a player.
•   <strong>Danilo:</strong> 5/10 - Not good enough.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5/10</strong>

This squad is a mess. There are a few bright sparks, but far too many average players who wouldn't get near the starting eleven of a genuinely competitive team. The defense is slow and prone to errors, the midfield lacks creativity, and the attack is toothless. Russell Martin is not the man to get the best out of this group. Rangers fans should expect another season of mediocrity with this team.</div>
