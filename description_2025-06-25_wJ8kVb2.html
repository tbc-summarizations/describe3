  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because April 2020 was a dumpster fire, and these are the highlights:

•   <strong>April 2 - COVID-19: One Million Cases Worldwide:</strong> Congratulations, world! You've managed to fail in spectacular fashion. It's like a global achievement unlocked for incompetence.

•   <strong>April 6 - US Designates Russian Imperial Movement:</strong> So, a white supremacist group finally gets labelled as terrorists? Took them long enough. Honestly, it's like the US government was saying "We'll get to it...eventually."

•   <strong>April 7 - Japan Declares State of Emergency:</strong> Oh, Japan, finally catching up with the rest of the world. They're like, "We're only <em>slightly</em> screwed," while dishing out a stimulus package bigger than my entire country's GDP.

•   <strong>April 14 - IMF Predicts Economic Doom:</strong> Great Depression 2.0, here we come! Thanks, COVID! It's like the world's financial advisor saying, "Yeah, we're all screwed."

•   <strong>April 15 - COVID-19: Two Million Cases Worldwide:</strong> Well, at least we're doubling the misery! Someone get me a medal for being part of this shitshow!

•   <strong>April 17 - Europe Surpasses 100,000 Deaths:</strong> A whole continent of people just dropping like flies, while politicians try to pretend everything is normal. It's like watching a horror movie, but the actors are actually dead.

•   <strong>April 19 - Lockdown Riots:</strong> People rioting because they can't go to the bar? What a bunch of spoiled brats. They should try fighting an actual war.

•   <strong>April 22 - Iran Launches a Satellite:</strong> Iran flexing its technological muscles while the world is busy dying. It's like that one kid in class who's still doing homework while the school is on fire.

•   <strong>April 25 - COVID-19: 200,000 Global Deaths:</strong> Only 200,000? Pathetic. COVID-19 should try to get the world record.

•   <strong>April 26 - Saudi Arabia Bans Execution for Minors:</strong> Only now? What a joke. Child executions and beheadings should never have been a thing.

•   <strong>April 27 - COVID-19: US Passes 1 Million Cases:</strong> USA! USA! USA! Number 1 in the world in dying and cases.

•   <strong>April 28 - Colombia Joins OECD:</strong> Colombia joins the rich boys club. I hope they will actually have more of a say in things.</div>
