  <div class="discord-text">FC Astana's Champions League campaign is absolutely legendary! To go from the group stages, where they dominated teams like Lyon and Copenhagen, to making a Cinderella run through the knockout stages, beating European giants like Ajax, Atletico Madrid, and Barcelona, is the stuff of dreams.

The fact that they only lost to Bayer Leverkusen in the final with a close score of 3-2 is just heartbreaking. But what a phenomenal underdog story!

Geoffrey Chinedu and Ousmane Camara leading the scoring charts is a testament to their attacking prowess, and Ivan Bašić pulling the strings with those assists shows a well-rounded team effort.

I'd rate this campaign a solid 9.5/10. It's the kind of run that will be talked about for years to come, even if they didn't lift the trophy in the end. It was an amazing showing of football.</div>
