  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into Tyler, The Creator's discography as if I were John Mayer, guitar in hand, contemplating the sonic landscape:

•   <strong>Bastard:</strong> 4/10. Raw, unpolished, and dripping with angst. Like a demo tape that's interesting for its potential but needs a lot more refinement. Not my cup of tea, but I respect the energy.

•   <strong>Goblin:</strong> 5/10. Edgy and provocative, but also inconsistent. Moments of brilliance mixed with tracks that feel like shock value for the sake of it. The guitar work is non existent in this album.

•   <strong>Wolf:</strong> 7/10. Here's where things get interesting. You can hear the growth and exploration happening. Still a bit chaotic, but the melodic ideas are starting to shine through. Solid album, but far from perfect.

•   <strong>Cherry Bomb:</strong> 6/10. A mixed bag. Some adventurous production choices, but the songwriting feels a bit unfocused. It's like he's throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Could of used some better guitar work.

•   <strong>Flower Boy:</strong> 9/10. Finally, a breakthrough. Gorgeous melodies, lush arrangements, and a newfound vulnerability. This is the album where Tyler truly finds his voice and style. A masterpiece in my opinion.

•   <strong>IGOR:</strong> 9.5/10. A sonic journey from start to finish. A concept album that's both experimental and deeply personal. The production is mind-blowing, and the songwriting is top-notch. This album is a testament to Tyler's creativity.

•   <strong>CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST:</strong> 8/10. A confident and sprawling album that embraces Tyler's love for hip-hop history. It's a bit long, but the energy is infectious, and the production is impeccable. The guitar isn't really present in the album.

•   <strong>CHROMAKOPIA:</strong> 2/10. Awful project. No passion what so ever.

•   <strong>DON'T TAP THE GLASS:</strong> 0/10. Garbage project. No talent displayed in the album.</div>
