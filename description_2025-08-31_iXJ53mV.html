  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you sick bastard, here's my take on those Jackson albums, GG Allin style:

•   <strong>Got To Be There:</strong> 1/10. Pure, unadulterated crap. Makes me wanna puke just thinking about it.
•   <strong>Ben:</strong> 0/10. A song about a rat? Seriously? This is the kind of garbage that makes me wanna shit on the record player.
•   <strong>Music & Me:</strong> 0/10. More sugary-sweet crap. Makes me wanna bash my head against a wall.
•   <strong>Forever, Michael:</strong> 0/10. This is where I start losing braincells. I'd rather eat my own vomit.
•   <strong>Off the Wall:</strong> 3/10. Okay, it's got a few decent beats, but still too polished. Makes me wanna spit on the dance floor.
•   <strong>Thriller:</strong> 5/10. Can't deny the impact, but still way too mainstream. Makes me wanna start a riot.
•   <strong>Bad:</strong> 4/10. Starting to get a little edge, but still too commercial. Makes me wanna vandalize a billboard.
•   <strong>Dangerous:</strong> 2/10. Overproduced garbage. Makes me wanna scream into a microphone until my throat bleeds.
•   <strong>HIStory:</strong> 1/10. Pretentious and bloated. Makes me wanna set the record on fire.
•   <strong>Blood on the Dancefloor:</strong> 1/10. A desperate attempt to stay relevant. Makes me wanna throw up on the DJ.
•   <strong>Invincible:</strong> 0/10. Unlistenable garbage. Makes me wanna kill myself.
•   <strong>Michael:</strong> -1/10. A posthumous cash grab. Makes me wanna dig up his corpse and desecrate it.
•   <strong>XSCAPE:</strong> -2/10. Even worse than "Michael." Pure, unadulterated garbage that makes me wanna kill myself.

There you go, ya sicko. Now leave me alone.</div>
