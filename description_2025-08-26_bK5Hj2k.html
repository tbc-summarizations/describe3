  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest assessment of those albums as if I'm judging them from the perspective of someone living in the 2010s:

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> Still weird and kinda pretentious. Some people will claim it's genius, but most just find it inaccessible and overly precious. Overrated.

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> Okay, Bowie's legacy is undeniable, but honestly, glam rock sounds kinda cheesy now. This album is still influential, but feels dated.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> Seriously, who has time for this? It's instrumental, long, and depressing. Probably only listened to by hipsters who wear exclusively black clothing.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> Emo kids will eat this up. It's depressing, poorly produced, and tries way too hard to be edgy. It's trying way too hard to get internet clout.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> Over-the-top vocals and melodramatic lyrics. Kind of a cliché "sensitive guy" album. It's alright but not groundbreaking.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> Finally, something actually good! Kendrick is a genius. The album is still culturally relevant and still hits as hard as it did when it came out.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> Prog rock? Get out of here. No one cares about 70s art-school experiments anymore. It does sound good, but it's extremely pretentious and inaccessible.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> Timeless. Lauryn Hill is a queen and this album is a masterpiece. Still relevant and still fire.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> Still a classic. Still weird, and DOOM's still as enigmatic as ever. It's still an underground classic, although it might be a bit too niche for mainstream appeal.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> Absolutely essential. A classic for a reason. Still relevant with it's political and social themes.

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> Jazz is boring. Pass.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> Nas is a legend. This is still a landmark hip-hop album and the production is amazing.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> Overplayed. It's alright, but people need to stop acting like it's the greatest album ever made.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> Prince is a god. This album is iconic, and the title track is legendary.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> Still influential, still depressing, still good. It's still considered one of Radiohead's best albums, but people are kind of tired of hearing "Nude".

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> Classic, but a bit long. Some filler, but the hits are undeniable.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> Still a banger. It's still a great album, even though some of the lyrics are kinda nonsensical.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> Beatles are overrated. It's a good album, but people need to chill out.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> Indieheads are so predictable. Overhyped and sounds like it was recorded in a trashcan.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> Wu-Tang is for the children. This album is essential hip-hop.</div>
