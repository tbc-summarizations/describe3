  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to unleash my brutally honest ranking of these former Geometry Dash hardest levels, from absolute garbage to the cream of the crop. Prepare for some controversial opinions!

<strong>The Absolute Worst - Scum of the Earth Tier:</strong>

1.  <strong>My First Level:</strong> Self-explanatory. If this was the "hardest," the game was truly doomed. Amateur hour.
2.  <strong>hard1:</strong> Generic, uninspired name. Guaranteed to be a generic, uninspired level.
3.  <strong>F:</strong> Just the letter "F"? Sounds like the creator gave up before even starting.
4.  <strong>Q:</strong> Same issue as "F." Lazy and screams of zero effort.
5.  <strong>help:</strong> If the creator needed help, they should have watched a tutorial, not inflicted this on the world.
6.  <strong>xy:</strong> Two letters? Are you kidding me? Peak unoriginality.

<strong>Bottom Tier - Barely Passable Garbage:</strong>

7.  <strong>Level 5:</strong> A slightly more descriptive, but still bland, name. Expect basic gameplay.
8.  <strong>Fast Dead:</strong> Implies speed, but probably just means frustratingly unfair.
9.  <strong>bate papo:</strong> Even the name is goofy. I can just imagine this being poorly designed and annoying.

<strong>Mid Tier - Meh, Could Be Worse:</strong>

10. <strong>The First 3 Trials:</strong> At least it has a concept. Probably still clunky and outdated.
11. <strong>To the Grave:</strong> Edgy name, but probably nothing special.
12. <strong>cave adventure:</strong> Generic platforming vibe, which doesn't translate well to Geometry Dash.
13. <strong>Atlantis:</strong> Could be visually interesting, but likely suffers from old design principles.
14. <strong>Snowstorm:</strong> Might have a cool aesthetic, but probably relies too much on blind jumps.
15. <strong>demons time machine:</strong> Intriguing name, but likely falls short of its potential.

<strong>Upper-Mid Tier - Showing Some Promise:</strong>

16. <strong>Leap of faith:</strong> Could be a challenging level with risky jumps, but also likely unbalanced.
17. <strong>I miss HLL:</strong> Implies difficulty and a cult following, but probably not actually that good. (Listed twice, so I'm putting it slightly higher).
18. <strong>Cant Let Go [Old]:</strong> Iconic for its time, but hopelessly outdated compared to modern levels. Deserves respect, but not a high ranking.
19. <strong>The Hell zone [Old]:</strong> More memorable than most on this list. Probably still frustrating by today's standards.
20. <strong>The Hell World [Old]:</strong> Similar to "The Hell Zone," but slightly less imaginative.

<strong>High Tier - Getting Interesting:</strong>

21. <strong>Darkness Tower:</strong> Ominous name with potential for a visually striking and challenging experience.
22. <strong>Touching Grass:</strong> A satirical take on geometry dash? Has to be at least interesting.
23. <strong>Nessus:</strong> Name has a mysterious and intimidating vibe. Probably a tough level with a unique style.
24. <strong>sailent clubstar:</strong> Obvious reference to Silent Clubstep, but probably a decent challenge in its own right.
25. <strong>Necrohol of Knights:</strong> Dark and epic name suggests a grand and challenging level.
26. <strong>PPLLlife:</strong> Weird name, but has a mysterious name that is intriguing. Probably an interesting and challenging level.

<strong>Top Tier - The Real Contenders:</strong>

27. <strong>BtSiK Silent - Convindix:</strong> Name implies both technical skill and difficulty. Might be a decent level.
28. <strong>Silent clubstep [Unnerfed]:</strong> A true legend, but its infamy stems from its extreme difficulty and questionable design. Still deserves respect.
29. <strong>Element 111 Rg:</strong> Specific and scientific-sounding name. Probably a well-designed and challenging level.
30. <strong>S Miller Never Clear [Unnerfed]:</strong> Implies insane difficulty and a dedicated following. Probably a brutal but rewarding experience.
31. <strong>Realm of Bloodshadow [Unnerfed]:</strong> Edgy but epic name suggests a visually stunning and incredibly difficult level.
32. <strong>SARY NEVER CLEAR [Old]:</strong> Similar to S Miller. Probably a hellish level.
33. <strong>ZiRNiTra:</strong> Short, memorable name implies a focus on optimization and precision.
34. <strong>Eternal Peter:</strong> This name is funny. But likely a good level due to it's ridiculous name.
35. <strong>Shatter2041 Silent:</strong> Futuristic name suggests a technically demanding and visually impressive level.
36. <strong>Divine Geometry:</strong> A fitting name for the hardest levels in Geometry Dash. Probably a visually stunning and incredibly difficult level.
37. <strong>Silent Circles [Unnerfed]:</strong> The original insane level. A true test of skill and patience. Deserves immense respect.

There you have it! My brutally honest ranking. This is, of course, just my opinion based on names and the general vibe I get.</div>
