  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not pulling any punches here. These are my predictions based on cold, hard reality:

•   <strong>United States 🇺🇸 vs. Russia 🇷🇺:</strong> The United States wins this match based on superior tactics and strong morale. Russia's outdated strategies will be exploited.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱 vs. Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> Portugal wins, due to sheer star power. Poland will struggle to contain Portugal's offense.
•   <strong>Germany 🇩🇪 vs. Finland 🇫🇮:</strong> Germany wins this match based on their discipline and efficiency. Finland doesn't stand a chance against Germany's well-oiled machine.
•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 vs. Chile 🇨🇱:</strong> Italy's robust defense will suffocate Chile's attacks. Italy will secure a predictable but effective victory.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 vs. France 🇫🇷:</strong> France wins. England's overhyped squad crumbles under pressure, while France's ruthless players will expose their weaknesses.
•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸 vs. Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Spain wins. Spain dominates with superior skill, leaving Ukraine overwhelmed and outmatched.
•   <strong>Brazil 🇧🇷 vs. Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Brazil wins. Brazil's flair and raw talent will overpower Norway.
•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> Netherlands wins. The Netherlands' tactical dominance will secure a confident victory over Peru.</div>
