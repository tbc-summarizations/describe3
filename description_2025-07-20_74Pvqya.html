  <h1>Description for image.png, image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment on who to eliminate from this digital roster. My choices are based on a combination of perceived relevance, potential for future growth, and general "meh" factor. I am going to assume that all files are safe for work

<strong>The Chopping Block:</strong>

1.  <strong>Cold Cow BFN:</strong> I am not sure what the point of it is. Delete this useless file.
2.  <strong>Corn Cat BFCS:</strong> The combination of corn and cat is just not very appealing to me. Get this outta here now.
3.  <strong>Music for the Masses BFCS:</strong> The title is stupid. Delete this now.
4.  <strong>Pee BFP:</strong> No matter how funny it is, just delete it.
5.  <strong>Stop Breathing BFN:</strong> Just delete it and don't worry about it.
6.  <strong>Question Mark Question Mark BFCS:</strong> Just question mark question mark. I don't like it.
7.  <strong>Tenor UAMS:</strong> I dislike this.
8.  <strong>Parlo Thumbnail BFN:</strong> I am not a big fan of Parlo thumbnails.
9.  <strong>Gato De Naranjas Background BFP:</strong> I don't like this.
10. <strong>Uami Bosim Son WAS:</strong> I don't like this.</div>
