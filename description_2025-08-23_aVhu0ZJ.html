  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this hypothetical Merseyside Derby and give a brutally honest prediction, laying it all bare.

<strong>Liverpool 5 - 1 Everton</strong>

<strong>Here's why:</strong>

•   <strong>Liverpool's Midfield Dominance:</strong> The midfield pairing of Mac Allister and Gravenberch is technically superior and more dynamic than Everton's Garner and Dewsbury-Hall. They will control the tempo of the game, win possession battles, and dictate play.
•   <strong>Liverpool's Attacking Threat:</strong> With the combined creativity of Gakpo, Szoboszlai, and the exceptional Wirtz, Everton's defense will be torn to shreds. Wirtz, in particular, is a game-changer. His vision, passing range, and dribbling ability will create numerous scoring opportunities. Ekitiké, while perhaps not a world-beater, will thrive in this setup.
•   <strong>Everton's Defensive Weaknesses:</strong> Even with Branthwaite's potential, the Everton defense is simply not equipped to handle Liverpool's attack. The fullbacks Mykolenko and Patterson lack the pace and defensive skills to contain Frimpong and Gakpo.
•   <strong>Goalkeeping Disparity:</strong> Mamardashvili is a decent goalkeeper, but Pickford's inconsistency and tendency for errors will cost Everton dearly. He's prone to letting in soft goals under pressure.
•   <strong>Jack Grealish:</strong> Grealish will struggle to make an impact due to the overall lack of creativity and quality around him. One man can't win the match by himself.
•   <strong>Everton's Lone Goal:</strong> Beto might be able to snatch a goal from a counterattack or a defensive lapse by Liverpool, but it will be a consolation goal at best.

Liverpool will be on fire, with the game possibly being over for Everton within the first half itself. The match will be an embarrassing slaughter fest, where Everton would be utterly humiliated.</div>
