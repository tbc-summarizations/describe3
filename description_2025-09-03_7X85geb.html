  <h1>Description for 220px-UEFA_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back on these Geometry Dash levels. Here's my brutally honest assessment:

•   <strong>Demon Park - M2coL:</strong> A relic. Overrated nostalgia trip. The gameplay is janky, and the deco is bland, 3/10

•   <strong>To the Grave - Darnoc2:</strong> Decent gameplay but the visuals are mid, 5/10

•   <strong>Extreme Park - Rabbitical:</strong> Fun level, 7/10

•   <strong>Demon World - superhexagon:</strong> Simple and iconic but kind of boring, 4/10

•   <strong>BP Night - RA7:</strong> Too old and simple to enjoy now, 3/10

•   <strong>The Hell Zone - Sohn0924:</strong> This level is a mess. The color vomit makes it an eyesore, and the gameplay is just annoying, 1/10

•   <strong>The Hell World - Sohn0924:</strong> Slightly better than The Hell Zone but still awful. The deco is still a chaotic mess, and it's not enjoyable to play, 2/10

•   <strong>Heaven And Hell - roadbose:</strong> Gameplay is decent but the deco is trash, 3/10

•   <strong>The Hell Origin - Sohn0924:</strong> Avoid this one like the plague. It's even worse than the other "Hell" levels. The gameplay is atrocious, and the deco is an absolute eyesore, 0/10

•   <strong>Stereo Demoness (Unnerfed) - MaJackO:</strong> A classic, the gameplay is fun and the deco is decent. 6/10

•   <strong>Silent Club - BlackP2SFull:</strong> Good gameplay but the deco is bad, 4/10

•   <strong>Element 111 Rg - DarkX:</strong> A classic, one of the most iconic levels in Geometry Dash, 8/10

•   <strong>ICE Carbon Diablo X - roadbose:</strong> Very fun level with decent gameplay, 7/10

•   <strong>Cataclysm - ggb0y:</strong> Good classic demon. Hard and fun. 7/10

•   <strong>Future Demoness (Unnerfed) - MaJackO:</strong> Very fun level, 8/10

•   <strong>Sonic Wave (Old) - Cyclic:</strong> Iconic, but now just a boring memory. 4/10

•   <strong>Fexty - SkyJax:</strong> This level looks bad and the gameplay is repetitive and boring, 2/10

•   <strong>Bloodbath - Riot:</strong> A legendary level. Deserves all the praise. 10/10

•   <strong>Theory of Darkness - Koopi:</strong> Decent but nothing special, 6/10

•   <strong>Phobos (Unnerfed) - Tygrysek:</strong> Decent gameplay but the deco is not that great, 4/10

•   <strong>Sakupen Hell - Noobas:</strong> Horrible. Gameplay is just a spamfest, and the deco is basic, 3/10

•   <strong>Athanatos (Unnerfed) - Exenity:</strong> Better than Sakupen Hell, and the gameplay is fun, 6/10

•   <strong>Sonic Wave - Cyclic:</strong> Good level overall, 7/10

•   <strong>Artificial Ascent - ViPriN:</strong> Too hard for being an easy extreme demon, gameplay is unfun, 2/10

•   <strong>Yatagarasu - ViPriN:</strong> A legendary level. Deserves all the praise. 10/10

•   <strong>Erebus - Rustam:</strong> Ugly to look at and annoying to play. Avoid, 2/10

•   <strong>Stalemate Redux - GdTheTactiq:</strong> Good gameplay and deco, 7/10

•   <strong>Digital Descent (Old) - ViPriN:</strong> Annoying and not fun to play, 3/10

•   <strong>Plasma Pulse Finale - Smokes:</strong> Very fun level, 7/10

•   <strong>Bloodlust - Manix648:</strong> Good, but not as iconic as Bloodbath, 8/10

•   <strong>Crimson Planet - TrueOmega:</strong> Overrated. The gameplay is forgettable, and the deco is boring, 5/10

•   <strong>Zodiac - Bianox:</strong> Visually nice but the gameplay is mid, 6/10

•   <strong>Tartarus - Riot:</strong> A legendary level. Deserves all the praise. 10/10

•   <strong>The Golden - Bo:</strong> Beautiful and fun to play. Masterpiece, 9/10

•   <strong>Firework - Cherry Team:</strong> Good level overall, 7/10

•   <strong>Slaughterhouse - IcEDCave:</strong> Good level but too hard, 5/10

•   <strong>Sakupen Circles - DrCuber:</strong> Good level overall, 7/10

•   <strong>Abyss of Darkness - Exen/Neiro:</strong> Ugly to look at and annoying to play, 3/10

•   <strong>Acheron - Riot:</strong> Very fun to play, 8/10

•   <strong>Avernus - PockeWindfish:</strong> Visually amazing, 8/10

•   <strong>Tidal Wave - OniLink:</strong> Visually amazing and fun to play, 9/10
