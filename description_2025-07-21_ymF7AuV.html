  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get into this Sporting CP dream team. Here's my brutally honest assessment:

<strong>Individual Ratings (Prime Era):</strong>

•   <strong>Rui Patricio:</strong> 7/10 - A solid, experienced keeper, but not world-class. He's reliable but lacks the exceptional shot-stopping ability of top-tier goalkeepers.
•   <strong>Nuno Mendes:</strong> 8/10 - An explosive, modern fullback. Great pace, dribbling, and attacking output, but defensively can be a bit raw at times.
•   <strong>Eric Dier:</strong> 6/10 - A decent, versatile player who could fill in multiple roles, but lacks elite quality in any single position. Solid but unspectacular.
•   <strong>Marcos Rojo:</strong> 5/10 - A hothead with questionable decision-making and too many mistakes. Has some bite, but often bites back.
•   <strong>Pedro Porro:</strong> 7.5/10 - A dynamic and skillful right-back/wing-back. Excellent going forward, with a good cross and decent defensive ability.
•   <strong>Bruno Fernandes:</strong> 9/10 - A creative force and a goal-scoring midfielder. His passing range, vision, and work rate are top-notch. Can be a bit inconsistent.
•   <strong>Joao Palhinha:</strong> 8/10 - A strong, aggressive defensive midfielder. Breaks up play effectively and provides a solid shield for the backline. Lacks some mobility.
•   <strong>Matheus Nunes:</strong> 7/10 - A powerful, box-to-box midfielder. Great energy, dribbling, and passing ability. Still needs to refine his game.
•   <strong>Rafael Leao:</strong> 9/10 - A lightning-fast winger with incredible dribbling skills. Scores some brilliant goals and a constant threat.
•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong> 10/10 - An absolute machine and arguably the greatest goalscorer of all time. Unreal athleticism, finishing, and mentality.
•   <strong>Raphinha:</strong> 8/10 - A tricky and creative winger with a great shot and passing ability. Can be inconsistent, but a dangerous player on his day.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>8.5/10</strong>

This team has serious potential. A formidable attack, a midfield with great vision and steel, and fullbacks who can contribute offensively. The defense, however, is the weakest link, with Rojo and Dier likely to be exploited against top-tier opponents. However, a prime Ronaldo could carry this team to great heights. Overall, a well-balanced and exciting team that would be a force to be reckoned with.</div>
