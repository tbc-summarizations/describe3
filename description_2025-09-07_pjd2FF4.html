  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to dissect these matches like a surgeon with a grudge.

<strong>Matchday 1: The Brutal Truth</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 2-1 Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> Netherlands barely scraped by against the Scots? Seriously? The Dutch need to get their act together. Scotland, you put up a decent fight, but decent doesn't win matches. Try harder next time.

•   <strong>Lithuania 🇱🇹 0-2 Belarus 🇧🇾:</strong> Lithuania, congrats on being consistently mediocre. Belarus, you managed to beat a team that's basically a glorified training dummy. Don't get too excited, you're still Belarus.

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 4-1 Kosovo 🇽🇰:</strong> Italy, you're supposed to be a footballing giant. Beating Kosovo by only 3 goals is embarrassing. Kosovo, you tried, but maybe stick to something you're actually good at, like... well, I'm sure there's something.

•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹 3-1 Cyprus 🇨🇾:</strong> Austria, good job on beating a team nobody cares about. Cyprus, at least you scored, but you're still going home with an L.

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 2-0 Faroe Islands 🇫🇴:</strong> France, you barely managed to score twice against the Faroe Islands? You should be ashamed of yourselves. Faroe Islands, good effort, but let's be real, you're not winning any trophies anytime soon.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 0-2 Iceland 🇮🇸:</strong> Kazakhstan, you're basically the football equivalent of Borat's socks. Iceland, well done, I guess? Beating Kazakhstan isn't exactly a monumental achievement.

•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 1-0 Israel 🇮🇱:</strong> Belgium, only one goal against Israel? You call yourselves a top team? Israel, tough luck, but maybe focus on other sports.

•   <strong>Montenegro 🇲🇪 3-0 Andorra 🇦🇩:</strong> Montenegro, well done on beating Andorra. You're still Montenegro though so don't expect too much. Andorra, maybe try a different hobby. Like chess. Or knitting.

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹 3-0 Albania 🇦🇱:</strong> Portugal, expected win. Albania, you are nothing.

•   <strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮 3-2 Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> Slovenia, you managed to beat Czechia. Well done, but try to keep it up and make something out of it. Czechia, what happened? You lost against Slovenia?

•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 2-1 Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> Switzerland, a win is a win, but don't get cocky. Serbia, you need to sort out your issues.

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷 1-2 Armenia 🇦🇲:</strong> Greece, what is even going on anymore? Get your heads out of your asses. Armenia, a fantastic win. Keep it up.

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 4-1 Luxembourg 🇱🇺:</strong> England, you managed to beat Luxembourg. Fantastic. Luxembourg, you are pathetic.

•   <strong>Latvia 🇱🇻 1-3 Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Latvia, you tried. Ukraine, keep playing like this!

•   <strong>Hungary 🇭🇺 5-0 Gibraltar 🇬🇮:</strong> Hungary, well done, you beat a team that should not exist. Gibraltar, close the borders.

•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴 3-0 Azerbaijan 🇦🇿:</strong> Romania, decent win but I expect you to keep it up. Azerbaijan, you are nothing.

•   <strong>Croatia 🇭🇷 7-0 Malta 🇲🇹:</strong> Croatia, good result, now show that you can do this against a real team. Malta, you are useless.

•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰 0-1 Northern Ireland 🇬🇧:</strong> North Macedonia, congratulations on playing a boring game of football. Northern Ireland, good for you on winning against nothing.

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸 2-1 Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> Spain, you only scored two goals against Bosnia? Shame on you. Bosnia, you should be ashamed of yourselves.

•   <strong>Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 4-0 San Marino 🇸🇲:</strong> Wales, stop playing against San Marino. San Marino, stop playing football and just dissolve as a country.

•   <strong>Germany 🇩🇪 0-1 Turkey 🇹🇷:</strong> Germany, you are useless. Bring back the old players. Turkey, well done, let's see if you can keep that up.

•   <strong>Bulgaria 🇧🇬 2-1 Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> Both of you are irrelevant.

There you have it, a brutal, no-holds-barred commentary. Now go out there and win some games...or at least try not to be completely humiliated.</div>
