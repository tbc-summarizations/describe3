  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to tear these groups apart with the cold, hard truth:

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Real Madrid:</strong> Always overhyped and somehow manage to stumble their way to the later stages despite being a shadow of their former selves. They'll top the group because the others are even more pathetic.
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> Pretenders. A team built on oil money and fragile egos. They'll play well in the group stage only to bottle it in the knockout rounds, as always.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> A team that everyone always expects something of, but ultimately fails.
•   <strong>Malmö:</strong> Cannon fodder. They're just here to make the other teams feel better about themselves. Expect a series of embarrassing defeats.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>VfL Wolfsburg:</strong> Who even cares about Wolfsburg? They had their moment, but they're back to being irrelevant. They might sneak into the knockout stages but will go out in the first round.
•   <strong>PSV Eindhoven:</strong> They exist. Nothing more, nothing less. They will go on to play in the Europa League though.
•   <strong>Manchester United:</strong> An absolute joke of a club. They'll be humiliated on the European stage.
•   <strong>CSKA Moscow:</strong> A team that nobody will care about. They will make everyone look terrible.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong> They're the "gritty" team that everyone pretends to love. They will lose in the knockout rounds though.
•   <strong>Benfica:</strong> A team that promises so much but delivers so little. They'll look decent but ultimately fade into obscurity.
•   <strong>Galatasaray:</strong> All bark and no bite. Expect a hostile atmosphere in Istanbul, but on the pitch, they're nothing special.
•   <strong>Astana:</strong> Another team just happy to be here. Expect them to get absolutely hammered in every game.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> Consistently disappointing in Europe. They have all the money in the world but no Champions League pedigree. They'll probably finish second and get knocked out by a real team.
•   <strong>Juventus:</strong> Aging squad relying on past glories. They might make it to the quarterfinals, but they're not the force they once were.
•   <strong>Sevilla:</strong> A Europa League specialist trying to play with the big boys. They'll get a reality check in this group.
•   <strong>Borussia Mönchengladbach:</strong> The plucky underdogs that everyone roots for, but let's be honest, they're not going anywhere.

<strong>Group E</strong>

•   <strong>Barcelona:</strong> Arrogant, overrated, and still probably going to win the group. Their style of play is boring.
•   <strong>Roma:</strong> Perennial underachievers. They talk a big game, but they never live up to the hype. They will scrape a second place finish though.
•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen:</strong> Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. They'll put up a fight, but they're not good enough to get out of this group.
•   <strong>BATE Borisov:</strong> Yet another team that's just making up the numbers. Expect them to park the bus and pray for a miracle.

<strong>Group F</strong>

•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> The boring behemoth. They'll crush everyone in the group and then inevitably lose in the semi-finals.
•   <strong>Arsenal:</strong> The kings of fourth place. They'll struggle to get out of the group and then get humiliated in the knockout stages, as is tradition.
•   <strong>Olympiacos:</strong> A team that gets by on passion and intimidation. They'll cause an upset or two at home, but that's about it.
•   <strong>Dinamo Zagreb:</strong> Utterly forgettable. They're just here to collect a paycheck.

<strong>Group G</strong>

•   <strong>Chelsea:</strong> Wildly inconsistent. They'll either win the whole damn thing or crash out in the group stage.
•   <strong>Dynamo Kyiv:</strong> A team that was once great but is now just a shadow of its former self. They'll make it to the Europa League.
•   <strong>Porto:</strong> Always a tricky opponent, but they lack the quality to go deep in the competition.
•   <strong>Maccabi Tel Aviv:</strong> They are in this group.

<strong>Group H</strong>

•   <strong>Zenit:</strong> A team that nobody outside of Russia cares about. They'll probably win the group because the competition is weak.
•   <strong>Gent:</strong> A team that you only hear about when they're in the Champions League. They'll be quickly forgotten.
•   <strong>Valencia:</strong> A once-great club that's now a mess. They might sneak into the knockout stages, but they won't go any further.
•   <strong>Lyon:</strong> Another team that promises much but delivers little. They'll be lucky to get a Europa League spot.

There you have it. Now go complain about my brutally honest assessment. I am not sorry for hurting anyone's feelings.</div>
