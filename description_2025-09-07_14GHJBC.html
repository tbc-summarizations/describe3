  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest and seriously detailed prediction of the European Championship tournament group stages, no sugarcoating:

<strong>Group A:</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> Top of the group, no doubt. Their squad quality is miles above the rest. They'll likely drop some points due to complacency or tactical experiments, but they're the clear frontrunners.
•   <strong>Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Second place. Haaland alone gives them an edge. They'll be inconsistent, but good enough to qualify.
•   <strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> Third place. Hard-working, but limited talent. They'll fight for every point, but ultimately lack the quality to challenge the top two.
•   <strong>Belarus 🇧🇾:</strong> Fourth place. Their decline is noticeable.
•   <strong>Lithuania 🇱🇹:</strong> Last place, cannon fodder.

<strong>Group B:</strong>

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> Top of the group, they will have no problem.
•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹:</strong> Second place. Solid team but will fall short.
•   <strong>Slovakia 🇸🇰:</strong> Third place. Nothing Special.
•   <strong>Kosovo 🇽🇰:</strong> Fourth place. No chance.
•   <strong>Cyprus 🇨🇾:</strong> Last place. Forgettable.

<strong>Group C:</strong>

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷:</strong> Winner. Simple.
•   <strong>Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> Second place. No real fight.
•   <strong>Iceland 🇮🇸:</strong> Third place. Will fight well, but still third.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> Fourth place. Will not win any matches.
•   <strong>Faroe Islands 🇫🇴:</strong> Last place. No chance.

<strong>Group D:</strong>

•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong> First place. Easy.
•   <strong>Russia 🇷🇺:</strong> Second place. Don't have what it takes to finish first.
•   <strong>Israel 🇮🇱:</strong> Third place. Mid level.
•   <strong>Montenegro 🇲🇪:</strong> Fourth place. Bad level.
•   <strong>Andorra 🇦🇩:</strong> Last place. Worst team of the group.

<strong>Group E:</strong>

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> Top of the group. No challenge.
•   <strong>Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> Second place. Fine team but lacking in some departments.
•   <strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮:</strong> Third place. Good but not great.
•   <strong>Albania 🇦🇱:</strong> Fourth place. Don't pose a threat.
•   <strong>Liechtenstein 🇱🇮:</strong> Last place. Will lose every match.

<strong>Group F:</strong>

•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭:</strong> First place.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> Second place. Good but need improvement.
•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> Third place. On a decline.
•   <strong>Armenia 🇦🇲:</strong> Fourth place. Not a contender.
•   <strong>Moldova 🇲🇩:</strong> Last place.

<strong>Group G:</strong>

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> First place. Obvious.
•   <strong>Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Second place. Good team.
•   <strong>Finland 🇫🇮:</strong> Third place. Lucky to be here.
•   <strong>Luxembourg 🇱🇺:</strong> Fourth place. Irrelevant.
•   <strong>Latvia 🇱🇻:</strong> Last place. No chance.

<strong>Group H:</strong>

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> First place.
•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴:</strong> Second place. Okay team.
•   <strong>Hungary 🇭🇺:</strong> Third place. Will struggle.
•   <strong>Azerbaijan 🇦🇿:</strong> Fourth place. Weak.
•   <strong>Gibraltar 🇬🇮:</strong> Last place. Will get smashed.

<strong>Group I:</strong>

•   <strong>Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> First place. Good team.
•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰:</strong> Second place. Won't do much.
•   <strong>Northern Ireland 🇬🇧:</strong> Third place. Not good.
•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰:</strong> Fourth place. No chance.
•   <strong>Malta 🇲🇹:</strong> Last place. Trash.

<strong>Group J:</strong>

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> First place. Easy
•   <strong>Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Second place. Decent team.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> Third place. Irrelevant.
•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪:</strong> Fourth place. Unimportant.
•   <strong>San Marino 🇸🇲:</strong> Last place. Will get battered.

<strong>Group K:</strong>

•   <strong>Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> First place. They'll stroll this group.
