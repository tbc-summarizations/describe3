  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's my brutally honest take on these Conference League matches. No mercy.

<strong>Champions Path</strong>

•   <strong>Levadia</strong> scraping by against Iberia? Shows the level of Estonian football – barely competent. Iberia, you embarrassed the entire country of Georgia.
•   <strong>Linfield</strong> actually showing some grit against Žalgiris? A surprise, but let's not pretend they're suddenly world-beaters. Žalgiris, pathetic showing, you should be ashamed of yourselves!
•   <strong>Differdange 03</strong> teaching The New Saints a lesson in football? Embarrassing for Welsh football. The New Saints, you're an utter disgrace.
•   <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana</strong> doing the bare minimum against Inter Club? At least they got the win, but barely. Inter Club, you were never going to win and you proved that.
•   <strong>Milsami Orhei</strong> somehow beating Budućnost? Montenegrin football hits a new low. Budućnost, what a joke.
•   <strong>Egnatia</strong> demolishing Dinamo Minsk? Proves Belarusian football is a complete dumpster fire. Dinamo Minsk, pack it up, you're done.

<strong>Main Path</strong>

•   <strong>Dundee United</strong> doing what they should against UNA Strassen. Nothing special here. UNA Strassen, back to Luxembourg with you, you never had a chance.
•   <strong>Larne</strong> needing penalties against Prishtina? Pathetic display for both teams. Prishtina should have won the game earlier. Larne only won thanks to luck.
•   <strong>Neman Grodno</strong> edging out Košice? Slovakian football disappoints again. Košice, you should have done better.
•   <strong>Vaduz</strong> dispatching Dungannon Swifts with ease. Northern Ireland continues to be a footballing wasteland. Dungannon Swifts, stay in your league.
•   <strong>Silkeborg</strong> barely surviving against KA? Icelandic football is overrated. KA should be embarrassed of themselves.
•   <strong>Rosenborg</strong> destroying Banga? Expected, but still satisfying to watch Lithuanian teams get hammered. Banga, go back to Lithuania.
•   <strong>Dinamo City</strong> squeezing past Atlètic Club? Andorran football is a laughingstock. Atlètic Club, thanks for showing up.
•   <strong>Austria Wien</strong> annihilating Spaeri? Expected, but a good confidence boost. Spaeri, just a waste of time.
•   <strong>Ballkani</strong> getting the job done against Floriana. Maltese football remains irrelevant. Floriana, you were only there to make up the numbers.
•   <strong>Viking</strong> making a mockery of Koper? Absolutely brutal, a Norwegian masterclass. Koper, go home and rethink your life.
•   <strong>AEK Athens</strong> doing the bare minimum against Be'er Sheva? Disappointing performance for a Greek team. Be'er Sheva, predictable loss.
•   <strong>Győr</strong> winning against Pyunik? Armenian football never stood a chance. Pyunik, absolutely terrible.
•   <strong>Riga</strong> scraping by against Dila Gori. Georgian football disappoints again. Dila Gori, don't come back!
•   <strong>Raków</strong> showing no mercy to Žilina. Slovakian football is always a disappointment. Žilina, go back and try to improve.
•   <strong>Sabah</strong> dismantling Petrocub? Moldovan football continues to be a joke. Petrocub, get out of this tournament.
•   <strong>Ararat-Armenia</strong> just about edging out U Cluj. Romanian football underperforming as usual. U Cluj, don't even bother trying next year.
•   <strong>Santa Clara</strong> beating Varaždin? Croatian football struggling. Varaždin, go back to Croatia.
•   <strong>Kauno Žalgiris</strong> winning against Valur? Icelandic football overhyped as always. Valur, what a disgrace!
•   <strong>Paks</strong> scraping by against Maribor. Slovenian football is weak. Maribor, you were terrible!
•   <strong>Víkingur</strong> winning against Vllaznia? Albanian football continues to be a joke. Vllaznia, pathetic performance.
•   <strong>Hammarby</strong> scraping past Charleroi. Belgian football underperforming. Charleroi, go back to Belgium!
•   <strong>KÍ</strong> getting the job done against Radnički 1923. Serbian football failing. Radnički 1923, what a shame!
•   <strong>Jagiellonia</strong> destroying Novi Pazar. Another Serbian football team performing badly. Novi Pazar, embarrassing performance.
•   <strong>Polissya Zhytomyr</strong> defeating Santa Coloma? Andorran football is a laughingstock. Santa Coloma, predictable loss.
•   <strong>Lausanne</strong> destroying Vardar? Macedonian football has a lot to improve. Vardar, just a waste of time.
•   <strong>Brøndby</strong> winning against HB. Faroese football remains weak. HB, nothing to be proud of.
•   <strong>Partizan</strong> dismantling Oleksandriya? Ukrainian football underperforming. Oleksandriya, pathetic performance.
•   <strong>Spartak Trnava</strong> thrashing Hibernians? Maltese football is a joke. Hibernians, embarrassing performance.
•   <strong>St Patrick's</strong> scraping by against Kalju. Estonian football is weak. Kalju, nothing to be proud of.
•   <strong>AIK</strong> destroying Paide? Estonian football is terrible. Paide, embarrassing performance.
•   <strong>U Craiova</strong> defeating Sarajevo? Bosnian football has a lot to improve. Sarajevo, just a waste of time.
•   <strong>Aris Limassol</strong> crushing Puskás Akadémia? Hungarian football failing as always. Puskás Akadémia, embarrassing performance.
•   <strong>Shamrock Rovers</strong> defeating St Joseph's? Gibraltarian football is a joke. St Joseph's, predictable loss.
•   <strong>AZ</strong> destroying Ilves? Finnish football is never that impressive. Ilves, embarrassing performance.
•   <strong>Hajduk Split</strong> winning against Zira? Azerbaijani football failing as always. Zira, nothing to be proud of.
•   <strong>Arda</strong> winning against HJK Helsinki? Finnish football is never that impressive. HJK Helsinki, nothing to be proud of.
•   <strong>Sparta Prague</strong> defeating Aktobe? Kazakh football failing as always. Aktobe, nothing to be proud of.
•   <strong>Astana</strong> defeating Zimbru? Moldovan football failing as always. Zimbru, predictable loss.
•   <strong>Rapid Wien</strong> destroying Dečić? Montenegrin football continues to be a joke. Dečić, just a waste of time.
•   <strong>Maccabi Haifa</strong> defeating Torpedo Zhodino? Belarusian football failing as always. Torpedo Zhodino, pathetic performance.
•   <strong>Araz</strong> winning against Aris? Greek football underperforming as usual. Aris, embarrassing performance.
•   <strong>Omonia</strong> crushing Torpedo Kutaisi? Georgian football failing as always. Torpedo Kutaisi, pathetic performance.
•   <strong>İstanbul Başakşehir</strong> dismantling Cherno More? Bulgarian football is weak. Cherno More, just a waste of time.
•   <strong>Beitar Jerusalem</strong> thrashing Sutjeska? Montenegrin football is just bad. Sutjeska, pathetic performance.

That's my honest assessment. A lot of mediocrity and some expected results. Bring on the next round!</div>
