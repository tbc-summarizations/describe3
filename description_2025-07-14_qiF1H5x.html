  <h1>Description for 1000.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of what real-life ethnicity group 8-Ball would belong to, based on the image and personality you provided:

Given his monotone voice, insistence on not having a favorite number despite his name, and overall bland demeanor, I'd say he'd be Scandinavian. Specifically, I'm thinking someone from Norway or Sweden. They're known for being reserved, straightforward, and not easily excitable. 

The "8-Ball" name is kind of ironic for this personality type, as it suggests someone who is cool or edgy. This is in stark contrast to his apparent nature. This contrast could be viewed as a quiet rebellious trait that he has. Someone who wants to seem like a contrarian, but in reality he is following the status quo. This could be view as the behavior as most Scandinavian countries. They have a reputation for being safe and sterile as well, so it adds up in my mind.</div>
