  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back:

•   <strong>NSÍ Runavík:</strong> Pathetic. Losing to HJK as a Faroese team? Embarrassing. Back to your sheep farms. <strong>HJK Helsinki:</strong> Barely scraped by. You should be ashamed you struggled so much.

•   <strong>Torpedo Kutaisi:</strong> You needed a single goal to get you over the line? Disgraceful. <strong>Ordabasy:</strong> Getting knocked out by a team called Torpedo? Seriously? Hope you can find your way out of Georgia.

•   <strong>Željezničar:</strong> Two goals at home? Get good at football and maybe people will recognize your country! <strong>Koper:</strong> Good win, but it's Željezničar, so how impressed can I really be?

•   <strong>SJK Seinäjoki:</strong> SJK should fold as a club. Maybe try playing better football next time! <strong>KÍ Klaksvík:</strong> Crushing SJK is only good because it saves us from watching another SJK game.

•   <strong>Nõmme Kalju:</strong> Congratulations on not completely embarrassing Estonia. Small victories. <strong>Partizani:</strong> You lost to Nõmme Kalju. Just let that sink in.

•   <strong>Tre Fiori:</strong> You conceded five to a team whose country is located in the Caucasus? You might as well give up the sport. <strong>Pyunik:</strong> Okay, good job destroying San Marino. Now do something impressive.

•   <strong>St Patrick's Athletic:</strong> Beating a team from Lithuania is the bare minimum. Don't get cocky. <strong>Hegelmann:</strong> Pathetic. You got blanked. Go back to whatever field you call home and practice.

•   <strong>Dečić:</strong> A single goal to win the match? Mediocre. <strong>Sileks:</strong> Get better goalkeepers and maybe you'll have a chance next time.

•   <strong>Sutjeska:</strong> Barely beating a Belarusian team? Not exactly a triumph. <strong>Dynamo Brest:</strong> You lost to Montenegro. That's your legacy now.

•   <strong>Larne:</strong> Barely beating the Latvian League's Auda on penalties? Embarrassing. <strong>Auda:</strong> At least you put up a fight, but losing on penalties is still brutal.

•   <strong>Floriana:</strong> Beating a Welsh team by two goals? It's what everyone expected, but you did it. <strong>Haverfordwest County:</strong> Back to Wales with you.

•   <strong>Torpedo-BelAZ Zhodino:</strong> At least <em>someone</em> knows how to win decisively. Good job. <strong>Rabotnički:</strong> Zero goals? You made it easy for them, didn't you?

•   <strong>Bruno's Magpies:</strong> Seven goals at home?! You should be ashamed of yourselves. <strong>Paide Linnameeskond:</strong> Well done, Estonia. Now don't screw it up.

•   <strong>Birkirkara:</strong> Losing at home? Sad. <strong>Petrocub Hîncești:</strong> Good job, Moldova. Try to win a real game now.

•   <strong>Atlètic Club d'Escaldes:</strong> This is what happens when Andorra actually tries. Keep it up. <strong>F91 Dudelange:</strong> Luxembourg...you're better than this.

•   <strong>Valur:</strong> Good result for Iceland. But it's just Flora Tallinn. <strong>Flora Tallinn:</strong> Pathetic.

•   <strong>Malisheva:</strong> Nine goals? You're a disgrace to football. <strong>Víkingur Reykjavík:</strong> Nice massacre. Now do it against someone decent.

•   <strong>Racing Union:</strong> You lost to Georgia. How are you this bad? <strong>Dila Gori:</strong> Barely beating a team from Luxembourg? That's not a victory.

•   <strong>Vllaznia:</strong> Barely hanging on to win. <strong>Daugavpils:</strong> Back to Latvia.

•   <strong>Urartu:</strong> Six goals? You're better off just forfeiting next time. <strong>Neman Grodno:</strong> Good work.

•   <strong>Vardar:</strong> Good to beat La Fiorita. <strong>La Fiorita:</strong> Can't say I'm surprised you lost.

•   <strong>Kauno Žalgiris:</strong> Beating a team from Wales is the bare minimum. <strong>Penybont:</strong> You did your best, and it wasn't nearly enough.

•   <strong>St Joseph's:</strong> Barely beating a team from Northern Ireland? Just don't embarrass yourselves next round. <strong>Cliftonville:</strong> Tough luck.

•   <strong>Borac Banja Luka:</strong> You got knocked out by a team from Andorra? Are you kidding me? <strong>FC Santa Coloma:</strong> Upsetting a team from Bosnia is a win. Now do it again.</div>
