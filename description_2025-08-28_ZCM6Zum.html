  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I, Kenny G, would rate those Charles Mingus albums. Remember, this is just my opinion, man, and I like what I like!

•   <strong>Strings and Keys:</strong> 2/10 - Too much dissonance, not enough melody for my taste. Where's the smooth?

•   <strong>Jazz Collaborations Vol. 1:</strong> 4/10 - Some interesting ideas, but it gets a bit too chaotic. Needs more structure, you know?

•   <strong>The Moods of Mingus:</strong> 5/10 - A little better, but still a bit all over the place. Some moments are nice, but they don't sustain.

•   <strong>Jazzical Moods, Vol. 1:</strong> 3/10 - Not my style. Too abstract, not enough groove.

•   <strong>Jazzical Moods, Vol. 2:</strong> 3/10 - Same as Vol. 1. I need something I can tap my foot to.

•   <strong>Pithecanthropus Erectus:</strong> 4/10 - Some energy, but it feels disjointed. Not a fan.

•   <strong>The Clown:</strong> 5/10 - A bit more accessible, but still pretty out there. The narration is weird.

•   <strong>East Coasting:</strong> 6/10 - Okay, this is getting better. More of a traditional jazz vibe, but still has some Mingus weirdness.

•   <strong>Mingus Three:</strong> 7/10 - Not bad! Nice trio playing, good interplay. Still a bit angular for my taste, but I can appreciate it.

•   <strong>A Modern Jazz Symposium of Music and Poetry:</strong> 4/10 - The poetry thing doesn't do it for me. Music's okay, but the words are distracting.

•   <strong>Mingus Ah Um:</strong> 8/10 - Now we're talking! This has some real tunes, good energy, and a bit of edge. I can dig it.

•   <strong>Blues & Roots:</strong> 9/10 - Love this one! Great blues feeling, soulful playing, and some catchy melodies. Yes!

•   <strong>Mingus Dynasty:</strong> 7/10 - Solid album, good arrangements. A bit long, but some strong moments.

•   <strong>Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus:</strong> 6/10 - It's alright, but it gets a little self-indulgent. Needs more focus.

•   <strong>Newport Rebels:</strong> 4/10 - Too experimental, not enough substance. Feels like they're just trying to be different for the sake of it.

•   <strong>Pre-Bird:</strong> 5/10 - Some interesting ideas, but it's all over the map.

•   <strong>Mingus:</strong> 7/10 - A good effort, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of his best work.

•   <strong>Oh Yeah:</strong> 8/10 - Fun and funky! Mingus singing is a bit out there, but it's got a good vibe.

•   <strong>Tijuana Moods:</strong> 6/10 - The Mexican influence is interesting, but it doesn't always work. It's got its moments.

•   <strong>Money Jungle:</strong> 5/10 - With Ellington and Roach, but I still don't like it that much!

•   <strong>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> 3/10 - Sorry, but this is just noise to me. Too chaotic and avant-garde.

•   <strong>Mingus, Mingus, Mingus, Mingus, Mingus:</strong> 7/10 - Good album, but the titles are annoying.

•   <strong>Tonight at Noon:</strong> 6/10 - It's decent but not my favorite.

•   <strong>Mingus Plays Piano: Spontaneous Compositions and Improvisations:</strong> 2/10 - Too weird for me. Where's the melody?

•   <strong>Charles Mingus With Orchestra:</strong> 5/10 - Better but I still don't love it.

•   <strong>Blue Bird:</strong> 4/10 - Eh.

•   <strong>Pithycanthropus Erectus:</strong> 4/10 - Some energy, but it feels disjointed. Not a fan.

•   <strong>Let My Children Hear Music:</strong> 5/10 - Better but the orchestra just doesn't do it for me.

•   <strong>Mingus Moves:</strong> 6/10 - It's okay

•   <strong>Changes Two:</strong> 7/10 - Good but a little boring.

•   <strong>Changes One:</strong> 7/10 - Good but a little boring.

•   <strong>Three or Four Shades of Blues:</strong> 8/10 - Love this one! Great blues feeling, soulful playing, and some catchy melodies. Yes!

•   <strong>Lionel Hampton Presents: The Music of Charles Mingus:</strong> 5/10 - Not good not bad.

•   <strong>Cumbia & Jazz Fusion:</strong> 2/10 - Too weird for me. Where's the melody?

•   <strong>Me Myself an Eye:</strong> 4/10 - Eh.

•   <strong>Something Like a Bird:</strong> 4/10 - Eh.

•   <strong>Reincarnation of a Love Bird:</strong> 4/10 - Eh.

•   <strong>Incarnations:</strong> 4/10 - Eh.

•   <strong>Reincarnations:</strong> 4/10 - Eh.

There you have it! A Kenny G approved rating of all things Charles Mingus. Hope it's everything you wanted!</div>
