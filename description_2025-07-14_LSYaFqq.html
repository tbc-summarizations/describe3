  <h1>Description for 1000.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on Blocky's sadistic and reckless personality, as well as his tendency to pick on others without remorse, I would say he would be best represented by the stereotypes of a Russian mobster. This is due to the fact that Russian mobsters are often portrayed as being violent, ruthless, and unconcerned with the well-being of others. Additionally, Blocky's lack of social skills and tendency to stick with his friend group aligns with the image of a tight-knit criminal organization.</div>
