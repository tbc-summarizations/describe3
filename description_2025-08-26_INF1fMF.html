  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into this list like it's 1985 and I'm spinning these on my turntable, judging them with the discerning ears of a seasoned music fan from the era of big hair and even bigger sounds:

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) This sounds like some weird art-school project gone wrong. All those digital beeps and whispers? Give me a good synthesizer any day. Björk needs to find a real band.

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> Now this is more like it! Bowie knows how to put on a show. Ziggy Stardust is pure glam rock genius. One of his best, even compared to his earlier work.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) What in the name of new wave is this garbage? It's like a bunch of noise with no beat.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) Depressing, slow and boring. I'm not sure what type of music this is even attempting to be. I feel like my brain is melting just listening to it.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) This guy can sing, that's for sure. But it's a bit too sentimental for my taste. Could be a one-hit wonder. Let's see if he can keep it up.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) Hip-hop mixed with jazz? Get out of here. It will never work. There is no way this guy is going to make a hit from this.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> I have no idea what this is, but this is just a cacophony of noise to me. If this got any attention, then I would avoid it like the plague.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) I like some of the soul and R&B in this, but the rapping is kind of amateur. It will not last long.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) Another rapper with a gimmick. It's unique, but it's not going to get him anywhere. People don't want different they want generic.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> Marvin is at it again! His voice is still angelic and his songs still hit deep. What's Going On is an instant classic and will be talked about for years.

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> This is nothing but noise. I will probably not be playing it again.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) This guy can rap, alright. But he's just another gangster wannabe, talking about the same old stuff. It's not going to be a big deal.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> Floyd did it again! Their music just gets better and better. From the guitar riffs to the catchy vocals it just works.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> Now here's an artist who knows how to mix funk, rock, and a whole lot of attitude! I can play this when I am sad, happy or angry.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) More depressing garbage. What is wrong with people these days? Make me smile at least.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> Stevie can do no wrong. The funk and pop sound is infectious and will make you dance for days.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) A bunch of angry garbage. What is with these guys just yelling into microphones.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> Everyone knows the Beatles. Their music just is an instant hit that has some good rock-and-roll sounds.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) Nothing but some indie nonsense. It will never get played anywhere but a college dorm.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> (Release way ahead of it's time) The rapping is cool and all, but this is another flash in the pan. It's just trying to hard to be edgy.</div>
