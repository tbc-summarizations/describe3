  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here are 5 characters from the image I think would be great for Battle For Nitrous:

1.  <strong>PACKGOD:</strong> His presence alone would bring the savage energy needed for a brutal competition.
2.  <strong>JEFFREY EPSTEIN SIGMA PHONK:</strong> The aura of controversy and edge he exudes is perfect for stirring up drama and shocking eliminations.
3.  <strong>Garbage Human:</strong> His crude nature would make him the perfect villain character for Battle For Nitrous.
4.  <strong>Hyperlaser Gun:</strong> Who doesn't love some action? I'm sure Hyperlaser Gun will bring tons of it.
5.  <strong>fortnitegamer48:</strong> What could be funnier than having this little guy compete against some of the most badass characters?</div>
