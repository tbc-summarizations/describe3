  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this hypothetical footballer's career, going straight to the harsh truth.

<strong>Overall Career Rating: 8/10</strong>

<strong>Oleksandriya (2024-2026): 6.5/10</strong>
Decent start. He bagged some goals and assists, proving he had potential. But let's be real, the Ukrainian league isn't exactly the Champions League. It's a solid foundation, nothing groundbreaking.

<strong>AEK Athens (2026-2034): 9/10</strong>
This is where he became a star. Eight years of dominating the Greek league, racking up serious goals and assists. Four league titles and two cups show he was a key player. He was clearly too good for that league, and should have moved sooner.

<strong>Tottenham Hotspur (2034-2044): 7.5/10</strong>
At Tottenham, he had some incredible seasons, but the stats show his peak years were in Greece. He added important silverware to his collection, and managed to score quite a lot of goals still. It's a successful stint, but one that should be looked at with some regret.</div>
