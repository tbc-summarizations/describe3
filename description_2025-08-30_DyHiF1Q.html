  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my totally honest, Nickelback-approved take on these Fishmans albums:

•   <strong>Chappie, Don't Cry:</strong> 3/10 - Sounds like the kind of thing you'd hear at a dentist's office. Elevator music with a weird accent.
•   <strong>King Master George:</strong> 4/10 - A little more energy, but still feels like I'm stuck in a cheesy 80s arcade game.
•   <strong>Neo Yankees' Holiday:</strong> 5/10 - Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Catchy enough to not make me wanna smash my guitar, but still needs more distortion and less... whatever <em>that</em> is.
•   <strong>ORANGE:</strong> 6/10 - Has its moments, but it's all over the place. Feels like they're trying too hard to be artsy.
•   <strong>空中キャンプ \[Kūchū Camp]:</strong> 5/10 - More of the same. Drifting along, not really going anywhere. Someone wake me up when the riffs kick in.
•   <strong>LONG SEASON:</strong> 8/10 - Now this I can get behind. It's got a pulse, a groove, and some actual emotion. Still a little weird, but in a good way. Reminds me of our slower songs that the ladies love.
•   <strong>宇宙 日本 世田谷 \[Uchu Nippon Setagaya]:</strong> 7/10 - Similar to Orange, but a bit more focused. Still got that weirdness, but it's working for them here.
•   <strong>98.12.28 男達の別れ \[98.12.28 Otokotachi no wakare]:</strong> 9/10 - Epic. This is what I'm talking about! Raw energy, emotion, and enough guitar to make me wanna crack open a beer. If they just wrote a few more songs like <em>this,</em> they might actually be rock stars.</div>
