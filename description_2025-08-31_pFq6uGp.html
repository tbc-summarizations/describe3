  <div class="discord-text">Alright, alright, let's break down these Portishead albums, BEP style!

•   <strong>Dummy:</strong> 9/10. This album is FIRE! That moody trip-hop sound is just infectious. "Sour Times" and "Glory Box" are straight classics. Fergie would kill those vocals.

•   <strong>Portishead:</strong> 7/10. It's good, but doesn't quite hit the heights of <em>Dummy</em>. Still some cool grooves and haunting vibes, but a little more experimental in ways that don't always connect.

•   <strong>Roseland NYC Live:</strong> 6/10. Live albums are tough, especially when you're trying to capture that studio magic. It's solid, but the energy is a little flat for my taste. Where's the hype, people?!

•   <strong>Third:</strong> 3/10. Nah, this album is weird and boring. It's like they tried to be too artsy and forgot to bring the beats. Will.i.am wouldn't touch this with a ten-foot pole.</div>
