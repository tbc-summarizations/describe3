  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this World Cup-winning XI with the brutally honest approach you demanded:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Hugo Lloris (6/10):</strong> A solid, but not spectacular, goalkeeper. His tendency for errors under pressure is a constant worry, and honestly, he benefitted from a fortunate run of form and luck. He wasn't a game-changer like some other top keepers.
•   <strong>Benjamin Pavard (7/10):</strong> Scored a worldie, but that shouldn't blind anyone to his overall performance. He was decent defensively and surprisingly effective going forward at times, but definitely had limitations exposed at times.
•   <strong>Raphaël Varane (8.5/10):</strong> A rock in defense. His pace, reading of the game, and aerial ability were crucial. A true leader and arguably one of the best center-backs in the world during that tournament.
•   <strong>Samuel Umtiti (7/10):</strong> Partnered Varane well but not on his level. He was strong and committed, but his passing and positioning weren't always top-notch. Also was a liability for a penalty with his handball.
•   <strong>Lucas Hernandez (7.5/10):</strong> A committed and aggressive defender. Tackling and energy were fantastic and very needed. However, he can get caught out of position, and his attacking output was limited.
•   <strong>Paul Pogba (7/10):</strong> Talented, no doubt, but also inconsistent. Flashes of brilliance mixed with periods where he seemed disinterested. He scored a crucial goal in the final, but I felt it wasn't consistently dominant in midfield as he should've been.
•   <strong>N'Golo Kanté (9/10):</strong> The engine of the team. His work rate, tackling, and ability to win the ball back were phenomenal. He allowed the more creative players to thrive. An absolute world-class midfielder.
•   <strong>Kylian Mbappé (9.5/10):</strong> An absolute superstar. His pace, dribbling, and finishing were terrifying for defenders. Scored key goals and terrorized defenses. Without a doubt one of the best players in the world during the tournament and his future looked bright.
•   <strong>Antoine Griezmann (8/10):</strong> A smart and clinical player. His work rate was excellent. Scored important penalties, but was in general was relied on to do a little bit of everything and did it all well.
•   <strong>Blaise Matuidi (6/10):</strong> A hard worker and a good team player, but not particularly gifted technically. Provided energy and tactical flexibility, but offered little in the way of creativity or attacking threat. Seemed a bit out of place in the starting XI.
•   <strong>Olivier Giroud (5/10):</strong> While his hold-up play and aerial presence were useful, he didn't score a single goal in the tournament. His lack of goals for a striker in a World Cup-winning team is alarming.

<strong>Team Rating: 8/10</strong>

Overall, a very good team, but not an all-time great. The sum of its parts was greater than the individual quality of some players. They were tactically astute, defensively solid, and had moments of brilliance in attack. However, there were also weaknesses and inconsistencies, and they benefitted from a favorable run and a bit of luck along the way. There were definitely better teams throughout history.</div>
