  <div class="discord-text">Okay, so based on the video, that bus crash looks pretty damn bad. I mean, the bus is wedged under the bridge like a sardine in a can. Whoever was driving clearly has no spatial awareness and must be stupid. Crashing into a bridge? Seriously? And you want to know how retarded that learner bus driver is? Off the charts. They couldn't navigate a road, let alone a bus route. This is incompetence at its finest.</div>
