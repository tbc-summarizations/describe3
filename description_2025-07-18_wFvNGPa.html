  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these Champions League qualifying round results with the honesty they deserve:

•   <strong>Žalgiris 🇱🇹 2-2 Hamrun Spartans 🇲🇹 (Hamrun wins 11-10 on penalties 🇲🇹):</strong> Žalgiris, what a pathetic way to lose. A penalty shootout? Seriously? You couldn't finish the job in open play against Hamrun Spartans? Pathetic! Hamrun, congrats on the win, but let's be real, you barely scraped by against a team that should've been an easy meal.
•   <strong>KuPS 🇫🇮 1-0 Milsami Orhei 🇲🇩:</strong> KuPS, a 1-0 aggregate victory? You barely crawled past Milsami Orhei. KuPS should be ashamed of their performance. Milsami, well, at least you kept it somewhat respectable.
•   <strong>The New Saints 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 1-2 Shkëndija 🇲🇰:</strong> The New Saints, the only thing new about you is how easily you got knocked out. You had the chance to represent Wales, and you blew it. Shkëndija, not a spectacular victory, but you did what you had to do. Don't get too comfortable, though.
•   <strong>Iberia 1999 🇬🇪 2-6 Malmö 🇸🇪:</strong> Iberia, what a disaster. 6-2? Were you even trying? Malmö, you did what was expected of you, but don't think you're world-beaters just yet.
•   <strong>Levadia 🇪🇪 0-2 RFS 🇱🇻:</strong> Levadia, you couldn't even score a single goal over two legs? Embarrassing. RFS, a clean and tidy victory, but let's see if you can keep this form against tougher opponents.
•   <strong>Drita 🇽🇰 4-2 Differdange 03 🇱🇺:</strong> Drita, a solid win, but don't get ahead of yourselves. The real challenges are yet to come. Differdange, back to Luxembourg with your tails between your legs.
•   <strong>Víkingur 🇫🇴 2-4 Lincoln Red Imps 🇬🇮:</strong> Víkingur, Vikings should be known for their prowess and strength, not their pathetic performances. Lincoln Red Imps, good job taking advantage of the Faroese minnows.
•   <strong>Egnatia 🇦🇱 1-5 Breiðablik 🇮🇸:</strong> Egnatia, utterly humiliated. 5-1? You're a disgrace to Albanian football. Breiðablik, a dominant performance, but don't let it get to your heads.
•   <strong>Shelbourne 🇮🇪 2-1 Linfield 🇬🇧 [NIR]:</strong> Shelbourne, a narrow victory against Linfield. It was barely enough to get through. Linfield, better luck next year.
•   <strong>FCSB 🇷🇴 4-3 Inter Club d'Escaldes 🇦🇩:</strong> FCSB, you struggled to beat a team from Andorra? You should be ashamed of yourselves. Inter Club d'Escaldes, you put up a fight, but ultimately came up short.
•   <strong>Virtus 🇸🇲 1-4 Zrinjski Mostar 🇧🇦:</strong> Virtus, you're from San Marino. What else can I expect? Zrinjski Mostar, a routine victory against a team that shouldn't even be on the same field as you.
•   <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana 🇸🇮 1-3 Kairat 🇰🇿:</strong> Olimpija Ljubljana, losing to Kairat. Disgraceful. Kairat, a solid win, but don't get too excited. The competition gets tougher from here.
•   <strong>Noah 🇦🇲 3-2 Budućnost Podgorica 🇲🇪:</strong> Noah, a narrow victory, but a victory nonetheless. Budućnost Podgorica, close but no cigar. Try not to suck so badly next time.
•   <strong>Ludogorets 🇧🇬 3-2 Dinamo Minsk 🇧🇾:</strong> Ludogorets, barely scraped by against Dinamo Minsk. You need to step up your game if you want to go further. Dinamo Minsk, a valiant effort, but ultimately not enough.

There you have it. Brutally honest and to the point. These teams need to toughen up if they want to make any real noise in the Champions League.</div>
