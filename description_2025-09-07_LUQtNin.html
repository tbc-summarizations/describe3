  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up for some no-holds-barred commentary:

•   <strong>Netherlands 3-0 Belarus:</strong> Netherlands actually remembered they were supposed to be good. Belarus, well, they remembered they're Belarus.

•   <strong>Norway 3-1 Scotland:</strong> Haaland heard Scotland was talking trash. End of story. Scotland should stick to bagpipes, not footballs.

•   <strong>Italy 2-0 Cyprus:</strong> Italy sleepwalked through this one. Cyprus is so bad, they make Serie B look like the Champions League.

•   <strong>Slovakia 2-1 Kosovo:</strong> Slovakia wins, but I bet it was as exciting as watching paint dry. Kosovo, just keep showing up, I guess.

•   <strong>France 2-0 Iceland:</strong> France barely broke a sweat. Iceland is living off that one good Euro run from years ago. Get over it.

•   <strong>Sweden 2-1 Faroe Islands:</strong> Sweden struggled to beat the Faroe Islands? Pathetic. The Faroes can go back to fishing or whatever they do.

•   <strong>Belgium 5-0 Andorra:</strong> Belgium crushed Andorra as they should. Andorra's players are probably also part-time dentists.

•   <strong>Russia 0-1 Israel:</strong> Russia lost to Israel?! Embarrassing. Maybe Russia should focus on other things besides football.

•   <strong>Portugal 1-0 Czechia:</strong> Portugal won. Czechia... well, they got a participation trophy. Ronaldo probably carried them.

•   <strong>Liechtenstein 1-2 Albania:</strong> Liechtenstein almost tied Albania? Shocking! Albania barely showed up, but still managed to escape the humiliation.

•   <strong>Switzerland 4-0 Armenia:</strong> Switzerland cruised. Armenia is just making up the numbers at this point.

•   <strong>Moldova 1-2 Serbia:</strong> Moldova almost scored a second time? Better for them! Serbia is underwhelming, and that makes them mediocre.

•   <strong>England 1-0 Ukraine:</strong> England, ugh. They're boring. Ukraine got lucky that England didn't score more.

•   <strong>Finland 2-1 Luxembourg:</strong> Finland actually won something. Luxembourg should stick to banking.

•   <strong>Hungary 1-0 Azerbaijan:</strong> Hungary edges out a win? I bet it was as thrilling as reading the tax code. Azerbaijan are just there to make up the numbers.

•   <strong>Poland 4-0 Gibraltar:</strong> Poland destroyed Gibraltar, as if they were playing against a primary school team. Gibraltar, bless their souls.

•   <strong>Croatia 2-1 Northern Ireland:</strong> Croatia, barely pulled out a win? They are getting old. Northern Ireland got closer than they were supposed to be.

•   <strong>Denmark 3-0 Malta:</strong> Denmark, who cares? Malta went there for the holiday.

•   <strong>Spain 4-0 San Marino:</strong> Spain, great. San Marino is just a nice place for a vacation that pretends to be a national team.

•   <strong>Georgia 1-2 Bosnia:</strong> Bosnia had to scrape a win. Georgia should stick to wine and not football.

•   <strong>Germany 2-0 Estonia:</strong> Germany won with zero effort. They're so cold and systematic it's depressing. Estonia got paid to be there, what is their problem?

•   <strong>Ireland 0-0 Turkey:</strong> Ireland versus Turkey. An exciting score. Both of them should be embarrassed.

There you have it, my unbiased and utterly brutal assessment.</div>
