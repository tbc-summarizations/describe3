  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of Kairat's Champions League campaign:

<strong>Match Results Breakdown:</strong>

•   <strong>Kairat 1-0 Bayer Leverkusen:</strong> A lucky fluke. Leverkusen clearly underestimated them. 4/10.

•   <strong>Sturm Graz 0-0 Kairat:</strong> A bore draw against a mediocre team. Shows a lack of attacking ambition. 3/10.

•   <strong>Kairat 1-2 Sporting CP:</strong> Choking at home. They couldn't handle the pressure. 2/10.

•   <strong>Liverpool 2-1 Kairat:</strong> A predictable loss. They were lucky to score even one goal. 1/10.

•   <strong>Kairat 0-2 Inter Milan:</strong> Completely outclassed. They didn't stand a chance. 0/10.

•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk 1-2 Kairat:</strong> Another fluke victory. Shakhtar was probably having an off day. 5/10.

<strong>Overall Campaign Rating: 3/10</strong>

<strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong>

Kairat's performance was pathetic. Their two wins were against teams who clearly weren't taking them seriously. They couldn't compete against the big clubs and were deservedly eliminated. Their goal difference is atrocious, and they showed no real signs of progress or potential.

They were lucky to get any points at all. This was a waste of a Champions League spot.</div>
