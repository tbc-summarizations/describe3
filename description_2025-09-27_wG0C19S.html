  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's what I think of these tracks:

•   <strong>Daft Punk - Too Long:</strong> More like "Too Boring." Gets repetitive faster than a toddler watching "Baby Shark."

•   <strong>Bob Dylan - Desolation Row:</strong> Yeah, yeah, Bob, we get it, the world is messed up. Can you at least try to make it sound interesting? Sounds like a whiny hobo.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Earthmover:</strong> Depressing garbage. It's the soundtrack to staring at the ceiling and contemplating the futility of existence. Emo garbage.

•   <strong>Miles Davis - All Blues:</strong> Smooth jazz? More like smooth boredom. Perfect music for falling asleep during a wine and cheese party.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - Mortal Man:</strong> Pretentious rambling. The conversation with Tupac at the end is cringe-worthy.

•   <strong>Joanna Newsom - Emily:</strong> Her voice is nails on a chalkboard. This song is what I imagine it would sound like if a woodland creature was slowly being tortured.

•   <strong>King Crimson - Moonchild:</strong> Space is cool and everything, but I didn't need this much filler. The only thing that could be longer than this song would be the space this takes up in my brain.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (6-9):</strong> Overrated and self-indulgent. Gets old pretty quick.

•   <strong>Black Country, New Road - Basketball Shoes:</strong> This song is so long I could fall in love, start a family, and then hear my grandchildren saying "Are we there yet?" before it ends.

•   <strong>Kanye West - Last Call:</strong> A self-aggrandizing autobiography set to a beat. At least he admits he's full of himself.

•   <strong>Swans - Cloud of Forgetting:</strong> You'll forget you were even listening to it 5 minutes after it ends.

•   <strong>Car Seat Headrest - Beach Life-In-Death:</strong> What?

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5):</strong> Pink Floyd really milking it with this one.

•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - 1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be):</strong> Jimi, I love you, but this track is way too long and meanders like a stoned goldfish. I'm not sure what I'm more confused about: the plot or the lack of it.

•   <strong>Swans - The World Looks Red / The World Looks Black:</strong> Yeah, and this song sounds monochromatic, too.

•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Voodoo Chile:</strong> This makes me want to perform some voodoo on my ears to stop listening to it.

•   <strong>Car Seat Headrest - Famous Prophets (Stars):</strong> More like "Infamous Bore-phets."

•   <strong>Joanna Newsom - Only Skin:</strong> Her voice is even worse in this one.

•   <strong>John Coltrane - Part III - Pursuance / IV - Psalm:</strong> Too jazzy. Way too jazzy for its own good.

•   <strong>Mingus - Track D:</strong> What?

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Like Antennas to Heaven...:</strong> This song is so long and meandering, it's like the musical equivalent of reading a phone book in another language.

•   <strong>Swans - Frankie M:</strong> "Frankie M" stands for "Frankly, More of this?"

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Storm:</strong> More like a drizzle.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Static:</strong> Fitting title.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Sleep:</strong> I think I will!

•   <strong>Swans - Cloud of Unknowing:</strong> At least this song admits what it's doing to you.

•   <strong>Swans - The Glowing Man:</strong> More like the agonizingly slow-glowing man.

•   <strong>Pharoah Sanders - The Creator Has a Master Plan:</strong> The creator's plan obviously involved making this song last forever.</div>
