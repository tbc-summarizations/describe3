  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this supposed Champions League run by Tobol with the honesty it deserves.

<strong>League Phase:</strong>

The start was delusional. Beating Chelsea 2-0? Panathinaikos away? I'm rolling my eyes. It's amateur hour stuff. Then reality kicks in. Milan, Atletico, Brugge, Monaco, Barcelona all put them in their place. At least they managed a few wins against the real scrubs like Plzen, Basel and Copenhagen.

23rd out of 64 is a joke for progressing to the knockouts! This setup must be rigged. With 21 points! It is only progressing to the knockout stage due to the poor teams being faced. It's an absolute fluke that they even got there.

<strong>Round of 32:</strong>

Losing to PSV Eindhoven? They never had a chance. A 2-1 loss is embarrassing. 

<strong>Overall Rating:</strong>

<strong>2/10</strong>. Two points because they actually won a few games against truly awful opponents. This "campaign" is a disgrace to real football. Pure luck and benefiting from an overly generous tournament structure.</div>
