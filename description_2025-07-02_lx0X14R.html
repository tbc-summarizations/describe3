  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Andorra.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of Andorra's squad, position by position:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Josep Gomes:</strong> 4/10. Likely the best of a bad bunch, but that's not saying much. Probably makes a fair few blunders.
•   <strong>Iker Alvarez:</strong> 3/10. Unlikely to ever be a serious contender.
•   <strong>Xisco Pires:</strong> 2/10. Probably warming the bench or injured.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Moises San Nicolas:</strong> 4/10. Probably the most experienced, but likely past his prime. Makes sloppy mistakes.
•   <strong>Max Llovera:</strong> 3/10. Slow, struggles against pacey wingers.
•   <strong>Marc Garcia:</strong> 3/10. Mediocre positioning, gets caught out of position often.
•   <strong>Jesus Rubio:</strong> 2/10. Probably a squad filler, rarely sees the pitch.
•   <strong>Christian Garcia:</strong> 3/10. Lacks the physicality to dominate.
•   <strong>Joel Guillen:</strong> 2/10. Unlikely to make any meaningful impact.
•   <strong>Ian Olivera:</strong> 3/10. Has moments of promise but ultimately inconsistent.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Marc Vales:</strong> 5/10. Decent work rate, but lacks the quality to dictate play. Probably the best player in the team.
•   <strong>Marc Pujol:</strong> 3/10. A passenger on the field, offers little defensively or offensively.
•   <strong>Joan Cervos:</strong> 3/10. Uninspired, doesn't take risks.
•   <strong>Marc Rebes:</strong> 4/10. A bit of a bruiser, but lacks technical ability.
•   <strong>Eric Vales:</strong> 3/10. Often invisible during matches.
•   <strong>Joao Teixeira:</strong> 4/10. Decent technique but lacks physicality.
•   <strong>Luis Blanco:</strong> 2/10. Probably only plays because the options are so limited.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Albert Rosas:</strong> 3/10. Lacks pace, struggles to create chances.
•   <strong>Jordi Alaez:</strong> 3/10. Doesn't have the killer instinct.
•   <strong>Alex Martinez:</strong> 2/10. Probably a waste of space.
•   <strong>Ricard Fernandez:</strong> 3/10. Inconsistent finishing, wasteful in front of goal.
•   <strong>Aaron Sanchez:</strong> 2/10. Unlikely to make a significant impact.
•   <strong>Victor Bernat:</strong> 3/10. Lacks the quality to trouble defenders.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 2/10</strong>

This squad is likely going to struggle against any decent opposition. They lack quality in every position, and it's hard to see them scoring many goals or keeping many clean sheets. They're there to make up the numbers.</div>
