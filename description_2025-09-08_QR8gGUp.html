  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these Round of 16 matches:

•   <strong>Netherlands 1-1 Italy (Italy wins 4-3 on penalties):</strong> The Dutch choked. Simple as that. All that possession and they couldn't put away the Italians. Italy, on the other hand, played a cagey game and then kept their nerve from the spot. Textbook Italian efficiency. The Netherlands better go back to the drawing board. Losers.

•   <strong>Sweden 2-1 Belgium:</strong> Belgium's "Golden Generation" continues to tarnish. They were outworked and out-thought. Sweden, give them credit, they took their chances and played with the kind of grit Belgium seems to have misplaced. Belgium needs a complete overhaul, that squad is done.

•   <strong>Portugal 3-2 Croatia:</strong> Portugal barely scraped by an aged Croatia side. They still managed to win this one somehow but the team looks like they just aren't on the same page. As for Croatia they should be proud of themselves for nearly going through against such a good nation.

•   <strong>England 7-1 Hungary:</strong> England demolished Hungary. No contest. Their attack was ruthless, and their midfield bossed the game. Hungary was outclassed, outpaced, and outgunned. Should not have even made it this far.

•   <strong>Denmark 0-5 Spain:</strong> Denmark should honestly be ashamed of themselves. Completely dominated by Spain, they didn't even put up a fight. Spain came to play. Denmark came to get humiliated.

•   <strong>Germany 3-4 Norway:</strong> Germany, what a disaster. Conceding four goals? Against Norway? They should have gone with their B Team. On the other hand, Norway played with heart, took their chances, and exposed Germany's weaknesses.

•   <strong>Austria 1-4 France:</strong> Austria didn't even look like they belonged on the same field as France. France played like a machine, and Austria looked like a rusty bike. Should not have even made it this far.

•   <strong>Serbia 2-1 Czechia:</strong> A deserved win for Serbia. They were the better team. Czechia didn't have much of an attack. Serbia could easily make a name for themselves in the next round.</div>
