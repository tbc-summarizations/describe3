  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those matches:

•   <strong>Lithuania 2-2 Scotland:</strong> A draw? Scotland, seriously? You let Lithuania, a team that's usually happy just to show up, steal a point? Shame on you. Lithuania, congrats on the draw, but let's be real, you're still Lithuania.

•   <strong>Netherlands 1-0 Norway:</strong> A win is a win, but Netherlands, only one goal against Norway? Come on, where's the Dutch flair? Norway, you put up a decent fight, but close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.

•   <strong>Austria 1-0 Kosovo:</strong> Austria, barely scraping by against Kosovo? That's hardly anything to brag about. Kosovo, at least you kept it respectable, but you need to start turning these close games into wins.

•   <strong>Italy 4-1 Slovakia:</strong> Now that's more like it! Italy showing some dominance. Slovakia, you managed a consolation goal, but you were thoroughly outclassed. Back to the drawing board.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 3-1 Faroe Islands:</strong> Kazakhstan, good job on the win, but it's against the Faroe Islands. It's like celebrating beating up a toddler. Faroe Islands, keep at it, maybe one day you'll surprise someone...maybe.

•   <strong>France 2-2 Sweden:</strong> France, a draw at home against Sweden? That's embarrassing. Sweden, well done on snatching a point, but don't get too cocky.

•   <strong>Montenegro 2-1 Israel:</strong> Montenegro, a narrow win against Israel, not exactly earth-shattering. Israel, you almost pulled it off, but almost doesn't cut it.

•   <strong>Belgium 1-2 Russia:</strong> Russia, upset of the day! Taking down Belgium, that's a statement. Belgium, what happened? A home loss to Russia is unacceptable.

•   <strong>Slovenia 2-2 Albania:</strong> A draw between Slovenia and Albania? Yawn. Move along, nothing to see here.

•   <strong>Portugal 2-0 Liechtenstein:</strong> Portugal, a comfortable win, but against Liechtenstein? It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Liechtenstein, thanks for showing up, I guess.

•   <strong>Greece 0-0 Serbia:</strong> A goalless draw? Were they even trying? Both teams should be ashamed.

•   <strong>Switzerland 1-0 Moldova:</strong> Switzerland, another team barely edging out a win against a minnow. Moldova, better luck next time.

•   <strong>Latvia 1-2 Luxembourg:</strong> Luxembourg, a win! Finally, something interesting. Latvia, losing to Luxembourg? That's a new low.

•   <strong>England 2-0 Finland:</strong> England, a routine win against Finland. Predictable and boring. Finland, you put up a fight, but you're still Finland.

•   <strong>Romania 2-0 Gibraltar:</strong> Romania, expected win against Gibraltar. Gibraltar, you're the punching bag of Europe.

•   <strong>Hungary 1-0 Poland:</strong> Hungary, a good win against Poland. Poland, you're underperforming.

•   <strong>North Macedonia 1-0 Malta:</strong> North Macedonia, another uninspired win against a weak opponent. Malta, keep dreaming of a miracle.

•   <strong>Croatia 0-1 Denmark:</strong> Denmark, a great win against Croatia. Croatia, not your day.

•   <strong>Wales 0-1 Bosnia:</strong> Bosnia, good win away against Wales. Wales, you lost in front of your fans.

•   <strong>Spain 3-0 Georgia:</strong> Spain, as expected. Georgia, you have to get better.

•   <strong>Bulgaria 0-1 Turkey:</strong> Turkey, good win away against Bulgaria. Bulgaria, I had expected something more from you.

•   <strong>Germany 3-0 Ireland:</strong> Germany, excellent performance. Ireland, another loss, you're disappointing.</div>
