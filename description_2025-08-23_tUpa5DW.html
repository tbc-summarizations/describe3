  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this "Revierderby" on paper. Buckle up, Schalke fans, because it's not looking pretty.

<strong>Borussia Dortmund's Lineup:</strong> Dortmund, with the hypothetical signings of Waldemar Anton, Yan Couto, Maximilian Beier, and Serhou Guirassy, boasts a significantly superior squad. Gregor Kobel is a top-tier keeper, the defense has a nice blend of youth and experience with Ryerson and the newly acquired Anton, and the midfield pairing of Bellingham and Nmecha offers both steel and creativity. The attacking trio of Beier, Brandt, and Adeyemi provides pace, flair, and goal-scoring threat, and Guirassy up front is a proven finisher.

<strong>Schalke 04's Lineup:</strong> Schalke, on the other hand, is a complete mess. With all due respect, Loris Karius in goal is a disaster waiting to happen. The defense is League 2 quality at best, with Donkor, Kuruçay, Katic, and Becker. The midfield lacks creativity and bite, and the attacking options of Porath, Ba, Karaman, and Sylla are simply not good enough to trouble Dortmund's defense.

<strong>Scoreline Prediction: Borussia Dortmund 5 - 0 Schalke 04</strong>

Here's why:

•   <strong>Defensive Mismatch:</strong> Schalke's defense is laughably bad. Dortmund's attacking players will have a field day running at them. Karius will be picking the ball out of the net repeatedly.

•   <strong>Midfield Dominance:</strong> Dortmund's midfield will control the game from start to finish. Schalke's midfield will be overrun and unable to provide any meaningful support to the attack.

•   <strong>Attacking Prowess:</strong> Dortmund's attack is far superior to Schalke's. Guirassy will likely score multiple goals, and Beier, Brandt, and Adeyemi will all get on the scoresheet as well.

•   <strong>Motivation:</strong> This is the Revierderby. Dortmund will be up for the occasion and eager to humiliate their rivals. Schalke, on the other hand, will likely be intimidated and lacking in confidence.

This match has all the makings of a Dortmund rout. Schalke is simply outmatched in every area of the pitch. If the game ends any closer than 5-0, it would be a miracle.</div>
