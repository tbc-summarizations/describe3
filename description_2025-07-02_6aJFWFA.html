  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_England.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here’s the brutal truth about this England squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Jordan Pickford:</strong> 6/10 - Prone to errors at crucial moments. Not a top-tier keeper, but somehow always gets the nod.
•   <strong>Nick Pope:</strong> 4/10 - Seriously injured and never looked great even before that.
•   <strong>Aaron Ramsdale:</strong> 5/10 - Decent shot-stopper, but his decision-making is questionable.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold:</strong> 7/10 - World-class passer but a defensive liability. It's a gamble, honestly.
•   <strong>Harry Maguire:</strong> 4/10 - Slow, error-prone, and somehow still gets picked.
•   <strong>Kyle Walker:</strong> 7/10 - Still has pace and experience, but age is catching up.
•   <strong>John Stones:</strong> 7/10 - Good on the ball, but injury-prone.
•   <strong>Luke Shaw:</strong> 6/10 - Decent when fit, but can't stay healthy.
•   <strong>Marc Guehi:</strong> 6/10 - Solid but unspectacular.
•   <strong>Reece James:</strong> 7/10 - Top talent when fit.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham:</strong> 9/10 - World-class talent. The only thing wrong is that he's playing for England.
•   <strong>Jordan Henderson:</strong> 3/10 - Way past it and just there for vibes. Should be nowhere near this squad.
•   <strong>Declan Rice:</strong> 8/10 - One of the best defensive midfielders in the world.
•   <strong>Conor Gallagher:</strong> 5/10 - Energetic but lacks the quality needed at this level.
•   <strong>Cole Palmer:</strong> 7/10 - Talented and creative, but unproven on the big stage.
•   <strong>Kobbie Mainoo:</strong> 6/10 - Promising youngster but too inexperienced.
•   <strong>Curtis Jones:</strong> 4/10 - Not good enough.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Harry Kane:</strong> 9/10 - World-class goal scorer but needs service.
•   <strong>Marcus Rashford:</strong> 4/10 - Hugely inconsistent and out of form.
•   <strong>Bukayo Saka:</strong> 8/10 - Dangerous and exciting winger.
•   <strong>Ollie Watkins:</strong> 6/10 - Good goal-scorer but not top-tier.
•   <strong>Jack Grealish:</strong> 7/10 - Can change a game but inconsistent.
•   <strong>Phil Foden:</strong> 8/10 - Talented but sometimes struggles to shine in the national team.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6.5/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

This squad has talent, but it is also held back by a mixture of overhyped players who are also not good enough. The midfield is shaky and also full of injuries. The defense is questionable. The attack has potential, but it needs to click.

They are decent. No better and nothing special. Do not expect much from them.</div>
