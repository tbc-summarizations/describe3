  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this hypothetical knockout stage with the brutal honesty you demanded.

<strong>Quarter-Finals Commentary:</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands 2-0 Belgium:</strong> A clinical, almost boring, victory for the Dutch. This result screams "pragmatic football." Belgium, once a golden generation, is clearly fading. Depay continues to be a key man, and De Vrij chipping in shows their defensive strength can also contribute offensively. This scoreline is a damning indictment of Belgium's attacking potency. They were a shadow of their former selves.

•   <strong>Switzerland 1-3 Croatia:</strong> Croatia's experience and tournament savvy shone through. Switzerland, while spirited, lack the killer instinct. Perisic scoring early set the tone, and Pasalic's brace confirmed Croatia's dominance. Embolo's goal was a mere consolation. Frankly, Switzerland is consistently overrated; they always seem to fall short when the pressure mounts.

•   <strong>Germany 2-3 Spain:</strong> A goal fest. Germany and Spain's match result is more exciting than the real football match between the two teams. Morata’s resurgence continues, while the midfield orchestrates play. The German defense remains a liability. Overall, this was the game that you wanted to happen, a great offensive display, but also it showed that both sides are flawed.

•   <strong>France 3-0 Denmark:</strong> This was the expected victory. France is simply on another level compared to Denmark. Kolo Muani, Pavard, and Mbappe all getting on the scoresheet shows the depth of their attacking talent. Denmark offered little resistance; their fairytale run of the past is a distant memory.

<strong>Semi-Finals Commentary:</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands 1-0 Croatia:</strong> A tactical masterclass from the Dutch. They suffocated Croatia's midfield, and Gakpo's goal was enough to secure the win. This was an uninspiring match. Croatia's aging squad finally ran out of steam.

•   <strong>Spain 1(4)-(3)1 France:</strong> A penalty shootout decided this tense affair. Spain's resilience is commendable, especially after Isco's early penalty miss. France, despite Mbappe's goal, looked strangely disjointed. Rodri's own goal was the turning point. France's penalty takers crumbled under pressure, a sign of a team underperforming. The French choked, plain and simple.

<strong>The Final: Netherlands vs. Spain Prediction:</strong>

This is going to be a clash of styles. The Netherlands, with their organized defense and efficient attack, versus Spain's possession-based game. I'm leaning towards a Spain victory. The Dutch are well-drilled, but lack the individual brilliance to unlock a stubborn Spanish defense.

I predict a 1-0 win for Spain, with Ferran Torres scoring the decisive goal. The Netherlands will struggle to create clear-cut chances, and Spain's midfield will control the tempo. The Dutch will have a tough time, their defense, even with De Vrij, will be constantly tested.

<strong>Biggest Surprises:</strong>

1.  <strong>Spain defeating France:</strong> France was the heavy favorite. Spain's penalty shootout victory, especially after Isco's miss, was unexpected.
2.  <strong>Belgium's Collapse:</strong> Losing 2-0 to the Netherlands in such uninspiring fashion was shocking. They were exposed as an aging team with no real plan B.

<strong>Teams That Disappointed:</strong>

1.  <strong>Belgium:</strong> They were woeful. Their golden generation tag is now a joke. Martinez's tactics were stale, and the players looked disinterested.
2.  <strong>France:</strong> Despite reaching the semi-finals, they underperformed. The penalty shootout loss exposed their mental fragility. They relied too heavily on individual brilliance rather than cohesive teamwork.
3.  <strong>Denmark:</strong> They failed miserably in the Quarter Finals.</div>
