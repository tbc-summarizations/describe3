  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rundown:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong> 9.5 - The best manager of all time, but no one is perfect, right?
•   <strong>Gianluigi Buffon:</strong> 9 - Top tier keeper, solid, but not flashy.
•   <strong>Paolo Maldini:</strong> 10 - Perfection. No argument.
•   <strong>Franco Baresi:</strong> 9.7 - Close to Maldini, a defensive genius, but Maldini was just that bit more.
•   <strong>Franz Beckenbauer:</strong> 9.5 - Revolutionary, but sometimes overrated due to his legacy.
•   <strong>Cafu:</strong> 8.5 - Great attacking fullback, sometimes lacking defensively at the highest levels.
•   <strong>Zinedine Zidane:</strong> 9.8 - Masterful, but could disappear in some games.
•   <strong>Michel Platini:</strong> 8.8 - Overrated because he played for Juventus.
•   <strong>Johan Cruyff:</strong> 9.6 - Influential, but his actual playing achievements are a bit less than his reputation.
•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong> 9.7 - Pure goals, but selfish at times, could disrupt team cohesion.
•   <strong>Ronaldo Nazario:</strong> 9.9 - Injuries prevent him from being a 10. When fit, unstoppable.
•   <strong>Lionel Messi:</strong> 10 - Undisputed GOAT. Period.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong> 9.3/10

<strong>Champions League:</strong>

This team would dominate the Champions League, but not without hiccups. The egos in the attacking lineup could clash. Ferguson would need to be at his best to manage them. They'd be favorites, but not unbeatable. 80% chance of winning.

<strong>World Cup:</strong>

The lack of defensive midfielders and the reliance on attacking fullbacks is a weakness. They'd score a ton of goals, but could be vulnerable on the counter. They'd still be favorites, but with a lower chance of winning than in the Champions League. 65% chance of winning.</div>
