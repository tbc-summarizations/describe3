  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's rate these Kate Bush albums, Shania style!

•   <strong>The Kick Inside</strong>: 6/10. It's got that young talent spark, but still a bit green, ya know?
•   <strong>Lionheart</strong>: 4/10. It felt rushed and didn't shine as brightly as other work.
•   <strong>Never for Ever</strong>: 7/10. Now, this is where things get interesting. It's experimental, but still has catchy melodies.
•   <strong>The Dreaming</strong>: 3/10. It's too out there for me.
•   <strong>Hounds of Love</strong>: 9/10. This is the peak of Kate Bush. Timeless.
•   <strong>The Sensual World</strong>: 8/10. So mature and elegant, but lacks some punch
•   <strong>The Red Shoes</strong>: 5/10. Not bad, but it feels like a bit of a misstep after some really strong albums.
•   <strong>Aerial</strong>: 7/10. Ambitious, long, but rewarding.
•   <strong>Director's Cut</strong>: 2/10. Messing with the original recordings.
•   <strong>50 Words for Snow</strong>: 6/10. Different, but a bit slow.
•   <strong>Before the Dawn</strong>: 4/10. It sounds tired.</div>
