  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal commentary you asked for:

•   <strong>Italy 6-1 Sweden:</strong> Italy absolutely destroyed Sweden. Looks like the Swedish meatballs were no match for Italian pasta. Sweden should stick to furniture design and leave the football to the pros.

•   <strong>Portugal 3-1 England:</strong> Portugal schooling England is always a satisfying sight. Guess the English lions turned into scared kittens. Maybe they should have focused less on their silly chants and more on the game.

•   <strong>Spain 4-2 Norway:</strong> Spain's victory was expected. Norway put up a fight, but Spain's skill and strategy were too much for them to handle.

•   <strong>France 3-2 Serbia:</strong> France narrowly beat Serbia. Serbia showed some resilience, but ultimately fell short. France better step up their game if they want to go all the way.</div>
