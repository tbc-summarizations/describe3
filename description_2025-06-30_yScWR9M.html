  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic sob story, shall we?

<strong>Section 1: Jealousy</strong>

•   <strong>"Taco's horrible actions start with jealousy..."</strong>: Newsflash, pal, everyone feels jealous sometimes. It's called being a human being. The problem isn't feeling jealous, it's letting it turn you into a toxic waste dump of bitterness and entitlement.

•   <strong>"Red got Co-Ownership easily despite Taco working hard for it."</strong>: Boo-hoo. Life isn't fair. Maybe Red is simply more competent, likeable, or just plain lucky. Instead of whining like a toddler, Taco should focus on improving himself and becoming someone <em>deserving</em> of co-ownership. Working hard doesn't guarantee success; it just means you put in effort. Deal with it.

•   <strong>"Taco became jealous of Blue getting into YPP..."</strong>: Oh, cry me a river! Someone else is succeeding, so obviously, it's a personal attack on Taco, right? Maybe Blue actually creates content that people want to watch, unlike Taco's "comparison videos" that are just glorified copyright infringement.

•   <strong>"Taco began making a morse code vent, blaming Blue..."</strong>: Wow, so mature. Instead of having a constructive conversation or, you know, actually working on his content, Taco resorts to passive-aggressive bullshit and blames someone else for his failures. What a spineless coward.

•   <strong>"He began to guilt trip Blue, which made Blue feel like this was all his fault."</strong>: Classic manipulator move. Instead of taking responsibility for his own shortcomings, Taco emotionally abuses Blue to make himself feel better. This is beyond pathetic; it's downright malicious.

In conclusion, Taco isn't just a victim of circumstance; he's an insecure, entitled brat who lashes out at others because he can't handle the fact that he's not the center of the universe. Get a grip, Taco, and grow up. The world doesn't owe you anything.</div>
