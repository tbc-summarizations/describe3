  <h1>Description for 500x500.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest "smash or pass" on these album covers:

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly (2015):</strong> SMASH. The raw energy, the symbolism... it's a powerful and iconic image.
•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life (1976):</strong> PASS. It's a bit dated and doesn't really grab me.
•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows (2007):</strong> SMASH. The textured, layered feel is intriguing.
•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here (1975):</strong> SMASH. Classic, memorable, and conveys the album's themes well.
•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven (2000):</strong> PASS. It's okay, but not especially striking.
•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine (2001):</strong> SMASH. Strange, otherworldly, and visually captivating.
•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy (2004):</strong> SMASH. The simplicity of the collage work is perfect.
•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic (1994):</strong> SMASH. Simple and straight to the point, represents the area well.
•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On (1971):</strong> SMASH. A classic portrait that encapsulates the album's message.
•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road (1969):</strong> SMASH. Instantly recognizable and iconic.
•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace (1994):</strong> PASS. A nice shot, but not particularly memorable.
•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady (1963):</strong> SMASH. Visually interesting, like it's a painting.
•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993):</strong> SMASH. Fits the music perfectly.
•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King (1969):</strong> SMASH. Disturbing and unforgettable.
•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2 (2001):</strong> PASS. It looks like it was made in 2 minutes and is bland
•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness (2008):</strong> PASS. A bit too bleak and depressing.
•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972):</strong> SMASH. Captures the album's persona.
•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998):</strong> SMASH. A classic representation of her identity.
•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity (2001):</strong> SMASH. It is well put together and a good representation.
•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain (1984):</strong> SMASH. It's iconic and recognizable.
•   <strong>Fiona Apple - When the Pawn… (1999):</strong> PASS. It's boring to look at
•   <strong>Sufjan Stevens - Illinois (2005):</strong> SMASH. Well put together and it is a beautiful cover.
•   <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric Ladyland (1968):</strong> PASS. A bit too psychedelic and messy for my taste.
•   <strong>Daft Punk - Discovery (2001):</strong> PASS. The blue is ok but nothing special
•   <strong>Miles Davis - Kind of Blue (1959):</strong> PASS. It's alright but doesn't really stand out.</div>
