  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I, Nickelback, would rate these Fishmans albums, brutal honesty and all:

•   <strong>Chappie, Don't Cry:</strong> 3/10. Weak sauce. Sounds like elevator music after a rough night. Needs some serious distortion and a beer.
•   <strong>King Master George:</strong> 4/10. A slight improvement, but still too mellow. I don't hear any riffs that make me wanna smash a guitar.
•   <strong>Neo Yankees' Holiday:</strong> 5/10. Okay, I hear a bit of energy here. It's got some potential, but it's not gonna make the crowd go wild.
•   <strong>ORANGE:</strong> 6/10. Getting warmer. I can hear some actual emotion here, but it's not quite the angst I need. Needs more balls.
•   <strong>空中キャンプ \[Kūchū Camp]:</strong> 5/10. Sounds like a song to play whilst camping. I am not into camping that much.
•   <strong>LONG SEASON:</strong> 2/10. Super boring. A song that is so long needs to make me want to listen to it. This one does not.
•   <strong>宇宙 日本 世田谷 \[Uchu Nippon Setagaya]:</strong> 8/10. Now we're talking! This has some genuine power. I'd play this on stage if I was being held at gunpoint, and didn't have my own songs on me.
•   <strong>98.12.28 男達の別れ \[98.12.28 Otokotachi no wakare]:</strong> 10/10. This is it. This is what I'm looking for. Raw energy, emotion, and a guitar sound that would make anyone lose their mind. Pure gold. I'd take this one over my own music any day, just for the soul of it.</div>
