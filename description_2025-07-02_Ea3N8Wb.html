  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Belarus.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the brutal truth about this Belarus squad.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Pavel Pavlyuchenko:</strong> 3/10. Likely a backup for a reason. Probably prone to blunders.
•   <strong>Sergey Ignatovich:</strong> 4/10. Marginally better than Pavlyuchenko, but still not inspiring confidence.
•   <strong>Fyodor Lapoukhov:</strong> 2/10. Sounds like someone pulled him out of the stands. Not expecting much.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Alyaksandr Martynovich:</strong> 6/10. The veteran holding things together. Probably past his prime but still the best they've got.
•   <strong>Denis Polyakov:</strong> 5/10. Average. Will make mistakes and get caught out of position.
•   <strong>Sergey Politevich:</strong> 4/10. Another average defender. Likely a liability against stronger opposition.
•   <strong>Kiryl Pyachenin:</strong> 3/10. Probably a weak link in the defense.
•   <strong>Zakhar Volkov:</strong> 4/10. More of the same. Unlikely to be a standout player.
•   <strong>Sergey Karpovich:</strong> 2/10. Sounds like a last-minute call-up. Expecting poor performances.
•   <strong>Pavel Zabelin:</strong> 3/10. Not inspiring any confidence.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Pavel Savitsky:</strong> 6/10. Probably the creative spark in the team. Needs to be closely marked.
•   <strong>Max Ebong:</strong> 5/10. Decent midfielder. Not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Yevgeny Yablonsky:</strong> 4/10. Average midfielder. Expecting average performances.
•   <strong>Vladislav Klimovich:</strong> 3/10. Unlikely to make a significant impact.
•   <strong>Nikita Korzun:</strong> 4/10. A bit more experienced, but still not top quality.
•   <strong>Yury Kavalyow:</strong> 3/10. Sounds like a squad player. Not expecting much.
•   <strong>Valery Gromyko:</strong> 5/10. Decent midfielder. Can contribute with some goals.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Vitaly Lisakovich:</strong> 7/10. The danger man. Has the potential to score goals. The only real threat upfront.
•   <strong>Ivan Bakhar:</strong> 4/10. Probably inconsistent. Can have good games and bad games.
•   <strong>Dmitry Antilevsky:</strong> 3/10. Another squad player. Unlikely to make a big impact.
•   <strong>Vladislav Morozov:</strong> 4/10. More of the same. Average striker.
•   <strong>Yevgeny Shikavka:</strong> 2/10. Probably not good enough for international level.
•   <strong>Herman Barkouski:</strong> 3/10. Young player, not ready for a big role.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 3.5/10</strong>

This Belarus squad looks painfully average. Martynovich and Lisakovich are the only players who stand out even slightly. Expect them to struggle against any decent opposition. They'll likely rely on defensive tactics and hope for a moment of brilliance from Lisakovich. Overall, a team lacking in quality and depth.</div>
