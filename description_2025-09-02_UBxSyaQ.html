  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Ligue 1 Most Valuable XI with the brutal honesty you demanded.

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Gianluigi Donnarumma (Goalkeeper):</strong> 7/10. He has the potential to be a world-beater, but his decision-making and consistency can be questionable at times. A top shot-stopper, but needs to iron out the errors.

•   <strong>Nuno Mendes (Left-Back):</strong> 8/10. Excellent pace, dribbling ability, and crossing. Can be caught out defensively, but his attacking threat is undeniable.

•   <strong>Willian Pacho (Centre-Back):</strong> 6/10. Solid, but unspectacular. Reliable in the air, good positioning, but lacks the dynamism and flair of a truly elite center-back.

•   <strong>Ilya Zabarnyi (Centre-Back):</strong> 6/10. Technically sound. Doesn't take risks or do anything flashy. More of a role player than a star.

•   <strong>Achraf Hakimi (Right-Back):</strong> 9/10. An absolute weapon. Pace, power, incredible attacking output. A defensive liability at times, but his overall impact is undeniable.

•   <strong>Vitinha (Defensive Midfielder):</strong> 7/10. Good passer, decent engine, but can disappear in big games. Needs to impose himself more consistently.

•   <strong>Joao Neves (Defensive Midfielder):</strong> 6/10. Great energy and passing abilities however he needs to be performing against better opponents for me to consider him worth the praise he gets.

•   <strong>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Attacking Midfielder):</strong> 7/10. A threat with the ball at his feet.

•   <strong>Julio Enciso (Attacking Midfielder):</strong> 7/10. Great off the ball but there are players with greater capabilities in better leagues.

•   <strong>Desire Doue (Attacking Midfielder):</strong> 6/10. Great pace and vision but has the tendency to make the wrong decisions which results in loss of momentum.

•   <strong>Gonçalo Ramos (Striker):</strong> 8/10. Goalscorer, good movement, decent in the air. Not a world-class talent, but a very capable finisher.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5/10.</strong> This team lacks balance and a clear identity. The defense is shaky, the midfield lacks bite, and the attack relies too heavily on individual brilliance. The team feels a lot more like a business deal than a team full of players. They are the definition of mid.</div>
