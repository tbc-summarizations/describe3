  <h1>Description for 1920px-Flag_of_Germany.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get down to business. This is about cold, hard football analysis, no room for sentimentality. Here's my brutally honest take on that 1990 Germany squad:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Bodo Illgner:</strong> 6.5. A decent shot-stopper, but prone to the occasional blunder. He was never world-class, just reliable enough.

•   <strong>Klaus Augenthaler:</strong> 7.5. A tough, uncompromising defender. A solid leader, but a bit limited technically.

•   <strong>Guido Buchwald:</strong> 7. Another uncompromising defender, with less leadership than Augenthaler. Not the quickest, but tactically smart and difficult to beat in the air.

•   <strong>Jürgen Kohler:</strong> 8. One of the best of the generation. Ruthless, aggressive, and surprisingly good on the ball. Could be a liability with his tackling at times, but his overall quality was undeniable.

•   <strong>Thomas Berthold:</strong> 6.5. A decent player. Workrate was great, but lacked the technical ability of some of his teammates.

•   <strong>Andreas Brehme:</strong> 8.5. Clutch. A fantastic penalty taker and a very dependable defender, capable of playing on either flank. Underappreciated for his technical skill.

•   <strong>Thomas Häßler:</strong> 7.5. A creative spark in midfield. Quick feet and a good passer, but could be bullied physically and lacked consistency.

•   <strong>Lothar Matthäus:</strong> 9. The heart and soul of the team. A complete midfielder. Dominated games, scored crucial goals, and drove the team forward. A true legend.

•   <strong>Pierre Littbarski:</strong> 7.5. A clever winger with great vision and passing ability. A bit lightweight, but a constant threat in the final third.

•   <strong>Rudi Völler:</strong> 8. A classic poacher. Nasty, physical, and always in the right place at the right time. Not the most technically gifted, but a lethal finisher.

•   <strong>Jürgen Klinsmann:</strong> 8.5. A dynamic forward with pace, power, and a great work rate. A bit theatrical at times, but his goals were crucial to Germany's success.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>8.5/10</strong>. A very strong team, with a great mix of experience, talent, and grit. They had a few weaknesses, particularly in goal and the full-back positions, but their midfield and attack were world-class. They were well-organized, tactically astute, and possessed a winning mentality. While not the most exciting team to watch, they were incredibly effective and deserved their World Cup triumph.</div>
