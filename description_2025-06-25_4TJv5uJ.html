  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these July 2020 events like they're a stale loaf of bread:

•   <strong>July 1 - Putin's Power Grab (Russia):</strong> Oh, look, Putin's rigging elections <em>again</em>? Shocking. It's like watching a geriatric toddler cling to his toys, except the toys are an entire nation. Get a grip, Vlad, your time is up.

•   <strong>July 7 - Bulgarian Protests:</strong> A bunch of Eastern Europeans try to oust the cabinet and Ivan Geshev with no success. Protests are a waste of time. All it does is make traffic worse and annoy people who are trying to live their lives.

•   <strong>July 10 - EU Expansion Shenanigans (Bulgaria, Croatia, EU):</strong> These countries want to be part of the Euro. It's like a wannabe influencer desperately trying to join the popular clique. Enjoy drowning in bureaucracy, folks.

•   <strong>July 10 - Erdoğan's Mosque Makeover (Turkey):</strong> Ah, Erdoğan, always playing to his base. Turning a museum back into a mosque? How original. It's like he's stuck in the Ottoman Empire while the rest of the world moves on. What a loser.

•   <strong>July 15 - Twitter Hack (Global):</strong> Seriously? Prominent figures got punked by a bitcoin scam? Maybe they should spend less time tweeting and more time learning basic cybersecurity. Bunch of idiots.

•   <strong>July 19 - Brahmaputra River Flooding (India, Nepal):</strong> Natural disasters suck, but let's be honest, India and Nepal are basically disaster magnets at this point. Maybe invest in some decent infrastructure instead of just waiting for the next monsoon to wash everything away.

•   <strong>July 21 - EU "Recovery" Fund (EU):</strong> Another EU bailout? Color me shocked. It's like they're addicted to throwing money at problems instead of actually fixing anything. Good luck with that, Europe.

•   <strong>July 25 - Kim Jong-un's COVID Panic (North Korea):</strong> Oh no, Kim Jong-un is scared of a virus? Maybe he should focus on feeding his people instead of building nukes. It's like a spoiled brat throwing a tantrum over a scraped knee.

•   <strong>July 30 - NASA's Mars Mission (Global):</strong> Space exploration is for nerds. It's like blowing a fortune on a glorified science fair project while there are still problems here on Earth. Get your priorities straight, NASA.

There you have it – a brutally honest roast of July 2020's highlights. No feelings were spared, and no sacred cows were left unslaughtered. Enjoy!</div>
