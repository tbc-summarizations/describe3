  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into this hypothetical Serie A Most Valuable XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Mike Maignan (AC Milan):</strong> 8.5/10 - Maignan is a top-tier keeper. Commanding presence, great reflexes, and good distribution. He's a difference-maker, and any team would be lucky to have him.

•   <strong>Federico Dimarco (Inter Milan):</strong> 7.5/10 - A solid wing-back who provides width and good delivery from crosses. Not an exceptional defender, but his attacking contributions make him valuable.

•   <strong>Alessandro Bastoni (Inter Milan):</strong> 8/10 - A very good defender. Calm on the ball, great passing range for a centre-back, and reads the game well. A modern defender who contributes to the attack.

•   <strong>Alessandro Buongiorno (Napoli):</strong> 7/10 - A promising young centre-back, but still a bit raw. Good in the air and a decent tackler, but needs to improve his decision-making and consistency. He does not play for Napoli, Torino.

•   <strong>Denzel Dumfries (Inter Milan):</strong> 6/10 - Overrated for Serie A. Athletic and energetic, but his technical skills and decision-making in the final third are questionable. He also has terrible hair and is quite ugly.

•   <strong>Scott McTominay (Napoli):</strong> 2/10 - WTF. He is not valuable and does not play for Napoli. There are so many options who are more valuable to have in Serie A than him like Koopmeiners or Calhanoglu.

•   <strong>Nicolo Barella (Inter Milan):</strong> 8.5/10 - A dynamic and energetic midfielder. Barella is a workhorse who contributes in every phase of the game. His intensity and passion are infectious.

•   <strong>Rafael Leão (AC Milan):</strong> 9/10 - A game-changer with electric pace and dribbling ability. Leão can unlock defenses on his own. Needs to be more consistent with his end product.

•   <strong>Ademola Lookman (Atalanta):</strong> 7.5/10 - A tricky winger with an eye for goal. Lookman has good technique and can score from various positions. Underrated and a bit inconsistent.

•   <strong>Christian Pulisic (AC Milan):</strong> 7/10 - A talented player with good dribbling and technique. Pulisic can be creative, but is too inconsistent and injury-prone to be considered truly top class. Also he is American.

•   <strong>Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan):</strong> 9/10 - A lethal striker with a knack for scoring important goals. Martinez is a clinical finisher, with an excellent work rate and great movement. A top striker in Serie A.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6/10</strong>

This team looks alright on paper, but it has fundamental flaws:

•   <strong>McTominay ruins the midfield.</strong> I refuse to believe he is valuable.
•   <strong>Lack of defensive solidity.</strong> A three-man defense with wing-backs can be vulnerable if not properly protected.
•   <strong>Questionable balance.</strong> Too many attacking players could leave the team exposed defensively.
•   <strong>Inconsistent players.</strong> Some of the attacking players are prone to inconsistency, which could hurt the team's overall performance.

Ultimately, this team would be entertaining to watch, but it lacks the tactical balance and defensive solidity to be considered a top-tier side in Serie A.</div>
