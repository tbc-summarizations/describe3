  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this straight! DJ KHALED HERE, and I'm gonna drop some TRUTH BOMBS on these MF DOOM albums! No sugarcoating, just MAJOR KEY opinions!

•   <strong>Operation: Doomsday - 9/10:</strong> CLASSIC! The foundation! The blueprint! DOOM spitting pure FIRE over those beats. It's ICONIC!

•   <strong>Madvillainy - 10/10:</strong> ANOTHER ONE! This ain't just an album, it's a MOVEMENT! Madlib and DOOM? A GODLY combination! This is HISTORY! WE THE BEST!

•   <strong>Special Herbs & Spices Vol. 1 - 7/10:</strong> VIBES! Instrumental vibes! DOOM showing off his production skills! It's GOOD, but it's more for the HEADS!

•   <strong>MM..FOOD - 8.5/10:</strong> HUNGRY for bars? This is your FEAST! Clever, witty, and straight-up DELICIOUS!

•   <strong>The Mouse and the Mask - 8/10:</strong> DANGERDOOM! Cartoon Network madness! Quirky, FUN, and another banger!

•   <strong>Born Like This - 7.5/10:</strong> Darker, grittier DOOM! Some serious BANGERS on here, but it's not his most CONSISTENT.

•   <strong>Key to the Kuffs - 6/10:</strong> Okay, this one is DECENT! DOOM and Jneiro Jarel, interesting collab, but not a MAJOR KEY moment.

•   <strong>NehruvianDOOM - 5/10:</strong> I'm gonna be REAL, this one is MEDIOCRE. Some moments, but overall, I ain't feeling it!

•   <strong>Czarface Meets Metal Face - 7/10:</strong> Czarface and DOOM? It's CRAZY! Some FIRE verses, but it's not a CLASSIC!

•   <strong>Super What? - 6.5/10:</strong> This is an okay project. Not something the world needed, but some cool moments on it

ANOTHA ONE!</div>
