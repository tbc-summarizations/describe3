  <h1>Description for 250px-Flag_of_Turkey.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cut through the crap and rate these Turkish clubs:

•   <strong>Adana Demirspor:</strong> 6/10. Decent history, passionate fans, but often inconsistent and prone to drama. They have potential, but need stability.
•   <strong>Alanyaspor:</strong> 5/10. A relatively new club with some bright moments, but lack the history and consistent success to be considered truly great. Their coastal location is probably their biggest draw.
•   <strong>Antalyaspor:</strong> 5/10. Similar to Alanyaspor, they have flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lack the pedigree to compete with the top clubs. Their reliance on individual talent can be their downfall.
•   <strong>Besiktas:</strong> 8/10. A historic club with a strong fanbase and a track record of success. They have had some rough patches recently but they are one of the giants of Turkish football.
•   <strong>Bodrum:</strong> 3/10. New in the Turkish football, but inexperience will show.
•   <strong>Eyupspor:</strong> 4/10. Has a decent chance, but needs to improve.
•   <strong>Fenerbahce:</strong> 9/10. One of the "Big Three" with a massive fanbase, a rich history, and a constant pressure to win. They are always in contention for titles.
•   <strong>Galatasaray:</strong> 9/10. The other half of the Istanbul rivalry with Fenerbahce. Galatasaray is also a powerhouse with a strong European pedigree.
•   <strong>Gaziantep:</strong> 4/10. A team that goes under the radar.
•   <strong>Goztepe:</strong> 5/10. Similar to a lot of the other Turkish clubs, but needs to improve a bit.
•   <strong>Hatayspor:</strong> 4/10. Underachiever.
•   <strong>Kasimpasa:</strong> 4/10. The same as Hatayspor
•   <strong>Kayserispor:</strong> 5/10. Another team that needs improvement.
•   <strong>Konyaspor:</strong> 5/10. Just average.
•   <strong>Samsunspor:</strong> 5/10. A dark horse
•   <strong>Sivasspor:</strong> 6/10. Slightly above average.
•   <strong>Trabzonspor:</strong> 8/10. They made history in 2022, but it all went downhill from there.
•   <strong>Caykur Rizespor:</strong> 4/10. Underachieving.
•   <strong>Istanbul Basaksehir:</strong> 7/10. They are not big, but they had their moment.</div>
