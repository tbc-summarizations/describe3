•   <strong>Development Years (Lyon, Aston Villa, Tottenham, Manchester City):</strong> 7.5/10 - Solid performances in top leagues, but perhaps not the dominant force expected of a future superstar.

•   <strong>Peak Years (Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Arsenal):</strong> 9/10 - Consistent top-tier performances, numerous goals and assists, and a steady stream of trophies. This is where he established himself as a world-class player.

•   <strong>Late Career (Celtic, Sporting CP, Atlanta United):</strong> 8/10 - Still productive and impactful, even as he moved to leagues with a lower overall quality of competition. Proving his class and leadership.

<strong>Player Description:</strong>

Vahan Bichakhchyan was a dynamic and versatile attacking midfielder, known for his creative flair, goal-scoring ability, and exceptional playmaking skills. He was a threat both in the final third and in deeper positions, equally adept at unlocking defenses with precise passes and finishing chances himself. Bichakhchyan was a key player in numerous title-winning teams, demonstrating his ability to perform under pressure and deliver in crucial moments. While perhaps not the most physically imposing player, his technical skills, tactical awareness, and sheer determination made him a formidable opponent.</div>
