  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up for some unadulterated football commentary:

•   <strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 5-1 Lithuania 🇱🇹:</strong> Scotland, you finally remembered you're supposed to be a footballing nation. Lithuania, you played like you were Lithuanian.
•   <strong>Norway 🇳🇴 2-3 Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> Norway, close, but no cigar. You almost pulled a fast one on the Dutch, but they're still a cut above. The Netherlands, you got away with one there. Stop playing around and put teams to the sword.
•   <strong>Kosovo 🇽🇰 0-4 Austria 🇦🇹:</strong> Kosovo, stick to whatever else you're good at, because football ain't it. Austria, a routine victory against a team that barely qualifies as a footballing side. Don't get too excited.
•   <strong>Slovakia 🇸🇰 0-1 Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> Slovakia, close, but Italy had the edge. Italy, a boring 1-0 win. Must do better.
•   <strong>Faroe Islands 🇫🇴 0-0 Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> A goalless draw between two footballing powerhouses? I'm being sarcastic, of course. Next.
•   <strong>Sweden 🇸🇪 0-0 France 🇫🇷:</strong> Sweden, you parked the bus and somehow got away with it. France, what happened? Did you forget your scoring boots at home? Disgraceful.
•   <strong>Israel 🇮🇱 1-0 Montenegro 🇲🇪:</strong> Israel, a win's a win, even if it was against Montenegro. Montenegro, you're consistently mediocre.
•   <strong>Russia 🇷🇺 0-0 Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong> Russia, you actually managed to not embarrass yourselves against Belgium. Belgium, you should be ashamed of yourselves for not putting a few past the Russians.
•   <strong>Albania 🇦🇱 1-1 Slovenia 🇸🇮:</strong> Albania, a point is better than nothing, but you're not exactly setting the world on fire. Slovenia, you should have won this. Pathetic.
•   <strong>Liechtenstein 🇱🇮 0-5 Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> Liechtenstein, bless your hearts for even trying. Portugal, you should be putting double digits past these guys. Anything less is a failure.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 1-1 Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> Serbia, you have the talent, but you lack the killer instinct. Greece, you're just... there.
•   <strong>Moldova 🇲🇩 1-2 Switzerland 🇨🇭:</strong> Moldova, another loss to add to the pile. Switzerland, a win is a win, but don't expect any parades for beating Moldova by one goal.
•   <strong>Luxembourg 🇱🇺 2-0 Latvia 🇱🇻:</strong> Luxembourg, well done for actually doing something. Latvia, you're just rubbish.
•   <strong>Finland 🇫🇮 1-2 England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> Finland, good effort, but England are on a different level. England, you got the win, but you made it harder than it should have been.
•   <strong>Gibraltar 🇬🇮 0-1 Romania 🇷🇴:</strong> Gibraltar, you're improving, but still a long way to go. Romania, you barely scraped a win against Gibraltar? Embarrassing.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱 2-1 Hungary 🇭🇺:</strong> Poland, a solid win to keep your hopes alive. Hungary, not good enough.
•   <strong>Malta 🇲🇹 1-3 North Macedonia 🇲🇰:</strong> Malta, you tried, but North Macedonia are just too good. North Macedonia, a decent win, but nothing to write home about.
•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 2-1 Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> Denmark, a statement win against a top side. Croatia, you're not the team you used to be.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦 2-1 Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Bosnia, you finally showed some fight. Wales, you're relying too much on one player.
•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪 2-1 Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> Georgia, a shock win that will be talked about for years. Spain, what the hell was that? You were outplayed by Georgia.
•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 1-1 Bulgaria 🇧🇬:</strong> Turkey, you're always so close, yet so far. Bulgaria, not bad.
•   <strong>Ireland 🇮🇪 2-3 Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> Ireland, you almost caused an upset, but Germany are just too strong. Germany, a narrow escape. You need to up your game.

There you have it. Some harsh, but honest, takes on the latest round of matches.</div>
