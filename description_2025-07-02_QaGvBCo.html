  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Estonia.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Estonian squad with the ruthlessness it deserves:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Karl Jakob Hein:</strong> Showing promise, but still raw. Needs consistent game time. Potential: 6/10 Current: 4/10
•   <strong>Matvei Igonen:</strong> Decent shot-stopper, but not commanding enough. Average. 3/10
•   <strong>Karl Andre Vallner:</strong> Haven't seen enough to judge properly, but likely a backup. 2/10

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Karol Mets:</strong> Solid. Reliable. One of the few you can actually count on. 7/10
•   <strong>Joonas Tamm:</strong> Physically imposing, but prone to errors. 4/10
•   <strong>Artur Pikk:</strong> Decent going forward, questionable defensively. 3/10
•   <strong>Marten Kuusk:</strong> Average. Forgettable. 3/10
•   <strong>Maksim Paskotsi:</strong> Young and inexperienced. Could develop, but not there yet. 4/10
•   <strong>Rasmus Peetson:</strong> See Kuusk. Interchangeable. 3/10
•   <strong>Michael Lilander:</strong> Another average player. 3/10

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Mattias Kait:</strong> Probably the best midfielder they have. Needs to step up and dictate games more. 6/10
•   <strong>Vlasiy Sinyavskiy:</strong> Decent creativity, inconsistent. 4/10
•   <strong>Martin Miller:</strong> Average, and very unremarkable. 3/10
•   <strong>Markus Poom:</strong> Promising, but still young. Could develop into something more. 4/10
•   <strong>Mihkel Ainsalu:</strong> Hardworking, but lacking in quality. 3/10
•   <strong>Rocco Robert Shein:</strong> Another young player with potential. Needs to prove it. 4/10
•   <strong>Markus Soomets:</strong> 2/10

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Rauno Sappinen:</strong> Needs to be more clinical. Has flashes of brilliance. 5/10
•   <strong>Henri Anier:</strong> Past his prime. 3/10
•   <strong>Sergei Zenjov:</strong> A legend for them, but very much past his best. 3/10
•   <strong>Erik Sorga:</strong> Lacks the quality to make a real impact. 2/10
•   <strong>Alex Matthias Tamm:</strong> 2/10
•   <strong>Mark Anders Lepik:</strong> Unimpressive. 2/10

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

Harsh, but fair? <strong>3/10</strong>. This is a squad lacking in quality, depth, and genuine star power. Mets and Kait are the only players who you could genuinely call "good". They will struggle against any decent opposition. Expect a lot of defensive football and hoping for a lucky goal.</div>
