  <div class="discord-text">Alright, dale! Mr. Worldwide is here to drop some truth bombs on these Kendrick Lamar albums. No chaser, just straight-up ratings!

•   <strong>Section.80:</strong> 7/10. Aight, so it's got that raw energy, the hustle, the grind. Shows the potential, but it's not quite the polished diamond yet. Still, a good start for any player.

•   <strong>good kid, m.A.A.d city:</strong> 10/10. Now THIS is how you tell a story! The whole album is like a movie, man. Hits hard, makes you think, makes you feel. This is a classic. Dale!

•   <strong>To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> 9/10. Deep, complex, gets real. Might need a few listens to fully grasp, but once you do, it's like unlocking the secret level. Not for everyone, but a masterpiece for those who get it.

•   <strong>DAMN.:</strong> 8/10. Hits hard right away. Straight bangers, catchy hooks, but doesn't have the same depth as GKMC or TPAB. Still, a great album to blast in the ride.

•   <strong>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers:</strong> 7/10. It's introspective, personal, but it can be a bit much. Not his most accessible album. It's like he's in his own head, and sometimes you get lost in there with him. Solid effort, but not a repeat-on-loop kinda album for me.

There you have it. That's the verdict, Mr. Worldwide style. Now let's get back to the party! Dale!</div>
