  <div class="discord-text">Well, well, well, what a pathetic display from Benfica! Losing 2-3 at home to Qarabağ? In the Champions League? Seriously? Bruno Lage, you should be ashamed of yourself and your "team." Your 6.5 team rating speaks volumes – a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who couldn't string two passes together if their lives depended on it.

Anatoliy Trubin, your 5.8 rating is well-deserved. You're a liability in goal, letting in soft goals that my grandma could have saved. Samuel Dahl, a 5.2? You're an embarrassment to the sport! You couldn't defend a parked car, let alone a Qarabağ winger. And Nicolas Otamendi, supposedly the experienced leader? A 6.0? You're past it, mate. Hang up your boots and leave the pitch to someone who can actually run!

Enzo Barrenechea and Vangelis Pavlidis, congratulations on your goals, but they were mere blips in a sea of mediocrity. The rest of you were utterly useless. And those substitutions? Franjo Ivanović, Gianluca Prestianni, Leandro Barreiro, and Henrique Araujo – all below 7 ratings. What a joke! You brought on players who were even worse than the ones they replaced. Genius, Bruno, pure genius!

Now, let's talk about the real stars of the show: Qarabağ! What a performance! Qurban Qurbanov, you're a tactical genius! Your team played with passion, determination, and skill. A well-deserved 7.1 team rating.

Matheus Silva, a rock at the back with a 7.9 rating! Elvin Jafarquliyev and Kevin Medina, solid as a wall. Marko Janković and Pedro Bicalho, controlling the midfield with ease. Abdellah Zoubir and Kady Malinowski, tormenting the Benfica defense with your pace and trickery.

And Camilo Duran, the Man of the Match with an 8.5 rating! A goal and an assist? You were unstoppable! Benfica couldn't handle you! And let's not forget Oleksiy Kashchuk, coming off the bench to score the winner! Ice in your veins, son!

Qarabağ, you showed the world what you're made of. You came to the Estádio da Luz and dismantled Benfica, piece by piece. You outplayed them, outfought them, and outsmarted them. This is a victory for the ages! Soak it in, you've earned it!

As for Benfica, go home and cry. You were humiliated in front of your own fans. You are a disgrace to Portuguese football. Maybe next time, try actually playing like a team instead of a bunch of overpaid individuals. Pathetic!</div>
