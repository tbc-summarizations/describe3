  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up for some ruthless commentary!

•   <strong>Scotland 0-2 Netherlands:</strong> Scotland, you played like you were wearing kilts made of lead. The Netherlands showed you what real football looks like. Maybe stick to bagpipes.

•   <strong>Belarus 1-0 Lithuania:</strong> A whole 1-0? Were you guys playing in slow motion? At least Belarus managed to stumble across a win, unlike Lithuania, who apparently forgot how to score.

•   <strong>Kosovo 2-3 Italy:</strong> Kosovo, you put up a fight but choked in the end. Italy, you barely scraped by against Kosovo. That’s embarrassing.

•   <strong>Cyprus 0-2 Austria:</strong> Cyprus, you are pathetic. Austria, congratulations on beating a team that barely exists on the football map.

•   <strong>Faroe Islands 0-3 France:</strong> Faroe Islands, you were just there to make France feel good about themselves. France, good job beating a team of fishermen and sheep farmers.

•   <strong>Iceland 1-1 Kazakhstan:</strong> Iceland, your glory days are long gone. Kazakhstan, congrats on tying against a team that used to be good. This match was a snoozefest.

•   <strong>Israel 0-1 Belgium:</strong> Israel, you were unlucky, but whatever. Belgium, you are underperforming, you should've smashed this team to pieces.

•   <strong>Andorra 0-3 Montenegro:</strong> Andorra, why even bother? Montenegro, well done on defeating a team of amateur plumbers and teachers.

•   <strong>Albania 1-3 Portugal:</strong> Albania, you scored a goal! That's a victory in itself. Portugal, you should've won by more. Get your act together.

•   <strong>Czechia 0-0 Slovenia:</strong> A 0-0 draw? Did both teams forget they're supposed to be scoring goals? Pathetic.

•   <strong>Serbia 2-3 Switzerland:</strong> Serbia, you blew a lead and lost to Switzerland. You should be ashamed. Switzerland, you won but only just.

•   <strong>Armenia 2-0 Greece:</strong> Armenia, finally, you did something right! Greece, you got humiliated by Armenia, your ancestors are ashamed of you.

•   <strong>Luxembourg 0-2 England:</strong> Luxembourg, you never stood a chance. England, great, you beat Luxembourg. Now do something impressive.

•   <strong>Ukraine 5-0 Latvia:</strong> Ukraine, way to boost your goal difference against a team that couldn't defend a paper bag. Latvia, go back to the drawing board.

•   <strong>Gibraltar 0-3 Hungary:</strong> Gibraltar, you are a footballing black hole. Hungary, well done on beating a team that's basically a training exercise.

•   <strong>Azerbaijan 0-1 Romania:</strong> A 1-0 victory? Yawn. Romania, you should've crushed Azerbaijan.

•   <strong>Malta 0-1 Croatia:</strong> Malta, you tried your best to make it a match, but you still failed. Croatia, you played down to the level of your opponent. Wake up!

•   <strong>Northern Ireland 2-0 North Macedonia:</strong> Northern Ireland, a rare victory for you. North Macedonia, you got outplayed.

•   <strong>Bosnia 0-1 Spain:</strong> Bosnia, you put up a decent fight but still lost. Spain, you barely squeaked by. You are a disgrace.

•   <strong>San Marino 0-1 Wales:</strong> San Marino, congrats on not getting thrashed. Wales, you almost managed to lose. Embarrassing.

•   <strong>Turkey 0-0 Germany:</strong> A 0-0 draw? Both of you teams are worthless.

•   <strong>Estonia 1-1 Bulgaria:</strong> A draw? What is this amateur hour? You should hang your heads in shame.</div>
