  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's break down Kylian Mbappe's "Greatest XI" with brutal honesty:

<strong>Mbappe's Football Knowledge:</strong>

Frankly, it's questionable. He's clearly gone for a "greatest players of all time" approach, but the tactical construction and player selection raise eyebrows. Putting Zidane in a defensive midfield role is a strategic disaster. It's like buying a Ferrari and using it to plow fields. His actual knowledge looks like it is only limited to players. He just picked 11 legends and put them on a field.

<strong>The XI Rating (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Individual Brilliance:</strong> This team is overflowing with individual talent and the "best players of all time". There are 7 Brazilians in this, so it is like a Brazilian national team. There is even Ronaldo and Cristiano Ronaldo. All these players would've been better than Mbappe would ever be. Individually players like Neymar, Messi, Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos would have better football knowledge too.
•   <strong>Tactical Cohesion:</strong> This is where it all falls apart. Zidane as a lone defensive midfielder is ludicrous. The team lacks any real defensive bite or tactical balance. It's all attack, attack, attack, which might be fun to watch but would get demolished by a well-organized team.
•   <strong>Overall Rating: 3/10.</strong> It's a fantasy team, not a functional one. Great names don't always make a great team. If Mbappe had any proper knowledge he would've picked players who were at their absolute peak with players that actually suit the lineup. It would never work in real life. It is just a team for the looks and nothing else.</div>
