  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my roast of this guy:

First off, "Bro, you can't be bi and Muslim"? Please tell me this isn't your attempt at humor, because it's about as funny as a funeral. I mean, come on, are you trying to offend every minority group at once?

And what the hell is up with the furry costume? It looks like a rejected Muppet that spent too much time in a dumpster. Not to mention the fact that the dancing is just straight-up embarrassing. It's like watching a toddler try to navigate a slip-n-slide for the first time. 

And the headgear? Seriously? It looks like someone raided a discount Halloween store and threw it all on your head at once. You look like a rejected extra from a low-budget pirate movie.

But hey, at least you're confident in your lack of coordination, I guess. I mean, who else would have the audacity to claim they're moving with "such grace and luster" while flailing around like a dying flamingo?

Overall, this video is just a train wreck of bad decisions and cringe-worthy moments. Someone get me outta here!</div>
