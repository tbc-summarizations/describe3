  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take on the 2025 Ballon d'Or results:

<strong>Overall Impression:</strong>

This list is absurd. It reeks of recency bias, overrating players based on fleeting moments, and blatant favoritism. It's clear someone was either heavily influenced by a specific agent or has a bizarre affinity for PSG. The distribution of talent across different leagues seems completely ignored.

<strong>Specific Shockers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ousmane Dembélé winning?</strong> Absolutely laughable. I don't care if he's at PSG – his inconsistency and injury record alone should disqualify him. The man is a perpetual disappointment. The fact that he's ranked above players like Mbappé, Haaland, and Vinicius Junior is an insult.

•   <strong>Lamine Yamal so high?</strong> He's a promising talent, no doubt, but placing him second in the Ballon d'Or is ridiculous. It's pure hype based on a few flashes of brilliance. He hasn't consistently proven himself. Also winning the Kopa Trophy is equally absurd, it's pretty clear someone has put him too high.

•   <strong>Vitinha in the top 3?</strong> Are you kidding me? He's a decent midfielder, but certainly not Ballon d'Or material. To put him above Salah is almost criminal.

•   <strong>So many PSG players?</strong> The concentration of PSG players in the top 10 and throughout the list is suspicious and frankly, undeserved. It's not a reflection of individual brilliance but more of a club-centric bias. It's crazy that PSG even have the coach of the year.

•   <strong>Where's Rodri?</strong> The fact that Rodri is not even on the top 30 is crazy.

•   <strong>Scott McTominay at 18</strong> He is the embodiment of mediocrity, his performance is more inconsistent than the weather.

<strong>Outright Snubs:</strong>

•   <strong>Rodri</strong> Deserves a nomination, as he has been crucial to Manchester City.

<strong>Conclusion:</strong>

This list is a joke. It betrays a lack of understanding of consistent performance, impact on the field, and overall quality. It's a popularity contest disguised as an award, and it's a sad reflection on the state of football journalism. Whoever compiled this should be ashamed.</div>
