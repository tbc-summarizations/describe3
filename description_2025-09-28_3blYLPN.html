  <h1>Description for 418.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Real Madrid squad with brutal honesty.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Thibaut Courtois (🇧🇪):</strong> 9/10 - When fit, he's arguably the best in the world. Dominant presence, incredible shot-stopper, and commands his area. The injury is a concern, but his potential ceiling is immense.
•   <strong>Andriy Lunin (🇺🇦):</strong> 6/10 - A decent backup, but clearly a step below Courtois. Has shown flashes of brilliance, but lacks the consistency and big-game experience needed at this level.
•   <strong>Javi Navarro (🇪🇸):</strong> 3/10 - Unknown quantity. Probably a youth player filling a spot. Can't seriously rate him without seeing him play.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>David Alaba (🇦🇹):</strong> 7/10 - Versatile and experienced, but past his peak. Can play multiple positions, but his pace is declining. Relies more on his intelligence and positioning now.
•   <strong>Raul Asencio (🇪🇸):</strong> 2/10 - Probably just a squad filler, he has no real potential for improvement.
•   <strong>Alvaro Carreras (🇪🇸):</strong> 3/10 - Another unknown quantity, will probably amount to nothing.
•   <strong>Fran Garcia (🇪🇸):</strong> 6/10 - Decent full-back, but not a world-beater. Solid defensively, but lacks the attacking flair needed at Real Madrid.
•   <strong>Dean Huijsen (🇪🇸):</strong> 4/10 - He has a chance to be good someday, right now he just sucks.
•   <strong>David Jimenez (🇪🇸):</strong> 3/10 - Just a squad filler.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 9.5/10 - A phenomenon. Has completely transformed Real Madrid's midfield. Box-to-box, scores goals, tackles, and leads. A complete player with a massive future.
•   <strong>Eduardo Camavinga (🇫🇷):</strong> 8/10 - Immensely talented. Can play multiple positions and is a beast defensively. Needs to improve his passing and decision-making in the final third.
•   <strong>Federico Valverde (🇺🇾):</strong> 8.5/10 - Engine of the team. Runs all day, tackles, and has a rocket of a shot. Needs to be more consistent in his final product.
•   <strong>Aurelien Tchouameni (🇫🇷):</strong> 7/10 - Excellent defensive midfielder. Breaks up play and protects the defense well. Needs to improve his passing range and be more progressive with the ball.
•   <strong>Arda Güler (🇹🇷):</strong> 6/10 - Talented youngster with a lot of potential. Needs time to develop and adapt to the demands of Real Madrid.
•   <strong>Dani Ceballos (🇪🇸):</strong> 5/10 - A squad player who is good to fill up space, but isn't actually impactful.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Vinicius Junior (🇧🇷):</strong> 9/10 - Electric. One of the best wingers in the world. Pace, skill, and an eye for goal. Needs to be more consistent with his finishing.
•   <strong>Endrick (🇧🇷):</strong> 7/10 - Has immense potential. A Brazilian wonderkid with a bright future. But he's still young and raw.
•   <strong>Kylian Mbappe (🇫🇷):</strong> 10/10 - One of the best players in the world. Pace, power, skill, and a killer instinct. A game-changer who can win matches on his own. If he joins, Real Madrid's attack becomes terrifying.
•   <strong>Rodrygo (🇧🇷):</strong> 7.5/10 - Talented winger, but inconsistent. Can produce moments of brilliance, but needs to be more clinical in front of goal.
•   <strong>Gonzalo Garcia (🇪🇸):</strong> 2/10 - Just a squad filler and not even a good one.
•   <strong>Brahim Diaz (🇲🇦):</strong> 6.5/10 - He's alright. Nothing great.
•   <strong>Franco Mastantuono (🇦🇷):</strong> 2/10 - Unknown quantity, probably just filler.

<strong>Head Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Xabi Alonso (🇪🇸):</strong> 9/10 - A tactical genius. Proven himself at Bayer Leverkusen. Knows Real Madrid and commands respect. A great choice to lead the team.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

With the addition of Mbappe, this team would be a <strong>9.5/10</strong>. The midfield is world-class, the attack is devastating, and the defense is solid. The only question mark is the goalkeeper situation with Courtois' injury. But overall, this is a team capable of winning everything. Without Mbappe, it's an 8.5.</div>
