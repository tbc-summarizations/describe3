  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are five potential wars based on the map you provided, keeping it limited to minor countries/revolts in a 1v1 scenario:

1.  <strong>Benin vs. Togo:</strong> A border dispute flares up due to the discovery of valuable mineral deposits along their shared border, leading to armed clashes. This is because both of these countries are there.
2.  <strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo vs. Uganda:</strong> Long-standing tensions over rebel groups operating in the border regions escalate. Uganda accuses the DRC of harboring anti-Ugandan rebels, while the DRC claims Uganda is supporting insurgents within its territory. This is because both of these countries are there.
3.  <strong>Somalia vs. Yemen:</strong> A dispute over fishing rights and territorial waters in the Gulf of Aden escalates after naval skirmishes, leading to a full-blown but localized conflict. This is because both of these countries are there.
4.  <strong>Araucania vs. Chile:</strong> The Araucania region is already identified as active frontlines, and the Araucanian peoples were already fighting for their own recognized country (Araucania). So now, this region is trying to break away from Chile again causing a renewed war. This is because both of these countries are there.
5.  <strong>New Caledonia vs. France:</strong> The New Caledonian peoples also want to break away from France just like Araucania from Chile, This is because both of these countries are there.</div>
