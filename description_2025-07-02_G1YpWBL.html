  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back. This Bulgaria squad is rough, and I mean <em>really</em> rough. Here's my brutal assessment:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Plamen Iliev:</strong> 3/10. A journeyman keeper. Nothing special, prone to errors.
•   <strong>Dimitar Mitov:</strong> 4/10. Probably the best of a bad bunch. Still unproven at a high level.
•   <strong>Svetoslav Vutsov:</strong> 2/10. Seriously, why is he even here?

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Anton Nedyalkov:</strong> 5/10. Passable. Probably the only defender with some semblance of quality.
•   <strong>Valentin Antov:</strong> 4/10. Overhyped and inconsistent.
•   <strong>Viktor Popov:</strong> 3/10. Average at best, easily exposed.
•   <strong>Petko Hristov:</strong> 3/10. Another uninspired choice.
•   <strong>Ivan Turitsov:</strong> 2/10. Liability waiting to happen.
•   <strong>Kristian Dimitrov:</strong> 3/10. Forgettable.
•   <strong>Aleks Petkov:</strong> 2/10. Just no.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Georgi Milanov:</strong> 4/10. Was once promising, now just average.
•   <strong>Ivaylo Chochev:</strong> 4/10. Hard worker, but limited technical ability.
•   <strong>Georgi Kostadinov:</strong> 3/10. Completely unremarkable.
•   <strong>Filip Krastev:</strong> 5/10. The only midfielder with a spark of potential, but needs to deliver more.
•   <strong>Ilia Gruev:</strong> 4/10. Decent passer, but lacks physicality.
•   <strong>Ilian Iliev Jr.:</strong> 3/10. A name rather than a player.
•   <strong>Marin Petkov:</strong> 2/10. Useless.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Kiril Despodov:</strong> 6/10. The only reason to watch this team. Capable of moments of brilliance, but often isolated.
•   <strong>Bozhidar Kraev:</strong> 4/10. Inconsistent finisher.
•   <strong>Martin Minchev:</strong> 3/10. Lacks the killer instinct.
•   <strong>Radoslav Kirilov:</strong> 2/10. Waste of space.
•   <strong>Georgi Rusev:</strong> 3/10. Unimpressive.
•   <strong>Aleksandar Kolev:</strong> 2/10. Seriously?

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 2.5/10</strong>

This is a squad devoid of real quality. Despodov is the only player who would get into most decent national teams. The defense is shaky, the midfield is uninspired, and the attack is toothless. Expect a lot of losses and very few goals. This is one of the worst Bulgaria squads I've seen in a long time. They need a complete overhaul and a serious injection of talent, which, frankly, I don't see happening anytime soon.</div>
