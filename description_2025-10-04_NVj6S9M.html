  <h1>Description for 16779.png, 10481.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the breakdown of the squads and my brutally honest opinion:

<strong>Ordabasy:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeepers (5/10):</strong> Shaizada is probably their best bet, but none of them really scream "top quality". Pretty average overall.
•   <strong>Defenders (6/10):</strong> Malyi and Antić provide some experience, but the rest are a mixed bag. I don't see a rock-solid defense here.
•   <strong>Midfielders (5/10):</strong> Canadjija and Vakulko have potential, but the midfield lacks that real creative spark or defensive steel.
•   <strong>Attackers (6/10):</strong> Imnadze and Paulino could cause some trouble, but it's not a world-beating attack.
•   <strong>Overall Squad Rating: 5.5/10</strong> A decent squad, but nothing that really stands out. Lacks quality in key areas.

<strong>Tobol:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeepers (5/10):</strong> Much like Ordabasy, they are not good.
•   <strong>Defenders (7/10):</strong> Miladinović and Erlanov provide a solid base, and Ndiaye adds some pace. This is probably their strongest area.
•   <strong>Midfielders (7/10):</strong> Tagybergen is a quality player, and El Messaoudi adds some flair. More balanced and creative than Ordabasy's midfield.
•   <strong>Attackers (6/10):</strong> Umarov and Zuev have potential, and Signevich is a decent target man.
•   <strong>Overall Squad Rating: 6.5/10</strong> Tobol is the better team.

<strong>Verdict:</strong>

Tobol is the better team. They have a more solid defense and a more creative midfield. Ordabasy's squad is decent, but lacks the quality and balance of Tobol.</div>
