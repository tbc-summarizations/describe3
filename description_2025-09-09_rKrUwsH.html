  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cut the bullshit and get straight to it:

•   <strong>Netherlands vs. Belgium:</strong> The Netherlands, plain and simple. Belgium is a team living on reputation, clinging to a "golden generation" that has long since faded. The Dutch have better tactical structure and more ruthless finishing. Belgium's defense is creaky and their midfield lacks bite. Expect the Dutch to exploit those weaknesses with a convincing win.

•   <strong>Switzerland vs. Croatia:</strong> Croatia, but this one will be a slog. Switzerland is compact, organized, and difficult to break down. Croatia, on the other hand, relies on aging midfielders and moments of brilliance. I think Croatia's experience in big games will see them through, but expect a tense, low-scoring affair that might need extra time or penalties.

•   <strong>Germany vs. Spain:</strong> Germany is going to demolish Spain. Spain's midfield is full of showboaters who can't defend, and their attack lacks a proper focal point. Germany, on the other hand, is ruthlessly efficient, with a powerful midfield and a striker who knows where the goal is. This match will be a painful lesson for Spain, as Germany clinically exposes their weaknesses.

•   <strong>France vs. Denmark:</strong> France, and it won't even be close. Denmark had their moment a few years ago. France's attack is simply too powerful, and their midfield has the perfect blend of steel and creativity. Denmark might put up a fight early on, but France's sheer quality will overwhelm them.</div>
