  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Albania.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Albanian squad with the brutal honesty you demanded:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Thomas Strakosha:</strong> 6/10. Has moments of brilliance but lacks consistency. Seems to be past his prime.
•   <strong>Elhan Kastrati:</strong> 4/10. Not convinced he's at the level needed for international football. Makes too many mistakes.
•   <strong>Alen Sherri:</strong> 3/10. Unknown quantity, probably just filling a spot.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Elseid Hysaj:</strong> 7/10. Solid and experienced, but his attacking contribution is limited.
•   <strong>Ardian Ismajli:</strong> 6/10. Decent, but prone to lapses in concentration. Not top-tier.
•   <strong>Berat Gjimshiti:</strong> 8/10. The rock of the defense. Consistent and reliable, a true leader.
•   <strong>Arlind Ajeti:</strong> 4/10. Hasn't lived up to the early hype. Too many errors.
•   <strong>Mario Mitaj:</strong> 6/10. Promising young talent, but still raw and needs development.
•   <strong>Marash Kumbulla:</strong> 5/10. Injuries have derailed his career. Not the player he once promised to be.
•   <strong>Ivan Balliu:</strong> 5/10. Average player, not a standout.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Nedim Bajrami:</strong> 7/10. Creative spark, but can disappear in games.
•   <strong>Qazim Laci:</strong> 5/10. Hard worker, but lacks the quality to dictate play.
•   <strong>Amir Abrashi:</strong> 6/10. Gritty and tenacious, but limited technically.
•   <strong>Ylber Ramadani:</strong> 7/10. Solid defensive midfielder, breaks up play well.
•   <strong>Kristjan Asllani:</strong> 8/10. High potential, good passer and intelligent player. One of the key players for the future.
•   <strong>Keidi Bare:</strong> 5/10. Unremarkable.
•   <strong>Arber Hoxha:</strong> 4/10. Needs time to develop

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Rey Manaj:</strong> 5/10. Inconsistent.
•   <strong>Myrto Uzuni:</strong> 7/10. A threat in the final third, decent finisher.
•   <strong>Jasir Asani:</strong> 6/10. Decent player.
•   <strong>Armando Broja:</strong> 6/10. His potential is great but he needs to prove his worth now.
•   <strong>Taulant Seferi:</strong> 5/10. Forgettable.
•   <strong>Ernest Muci:</strong> 6/10. Unproven.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5.8/10.</strong>

This is a squad with a few bright spots (Gjimshiti, Asllani) but a lot of mediocrity. The defense is decent, but the attack lacks consistent firepower. They'll struggle against top opposition and will likely rely on defensive solidity and counter-attacks to get results. Overall an okay team with some potential.</div>
