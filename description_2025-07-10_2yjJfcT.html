  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Good god, what an absolute demolition! Paris Saint-Germain just curb-stomped Real Madrid in this Club World Cup semi-final, and honestly, it's embarrassing to watch. 4-0? Real Madrid? Managed by Xabi Alonso, a supposed tactical genius? Pathetic.

•   <strong>Early Onslaught:</strong> Two goals in the first 9 minutes? Ruiz and Dembele, you absolute beasts! Real Madrid's defense was caught napping, probably still dreaming about their siestas.
•   <strong>Ruiz Masterclass:</strong> Fabian Ruiz bagging a brace? A 9.1 rating? He ran circles around Madrid's midfield, making Tchouameni and Bellingham look like amateurs. The Man of the Match award is well-deserved, but honestly, give him the Ballon d'Or after this performance!
•   <strong>Real Madrid's "Attack":</strong> Mbappe, Vinicius, and Gonzalo Garcia? A supposed dream team, yet they couldn't even muster a decent shot on target. Mbappe with a measly 6.3 rating? Maybe he's regretting leaving PSG now!
•   <strong>Possession Domination:</strong> 68% possession for PSG? Real Madrid barely touched the ball. It's like watching a professional team play against a bunch of Sunday league players.
•   <strong>Courtois's Nightmare:</strong> Poor Courtois, stuck in the Madrid goal watching his team get sliced and diced. A 5.7 rating? Deservedly so, he couldn't save a single decent shot.
•   <strong>Luis Enrique's Brilliance:</strong> A 7.5 team rating for PSG? Enrique's tactics were spot-on, exploiting Madrid's weaknesses with ruthless efficiency. Meanwhile, Xabi Alonso looks like he's aged 20 years on the touchline.

Final Verdict: Real Madrid, you got utterly humiliated. Alonso, your tactics were atrocious. PSG, congratulations on reaching the final in style. This match was a statement of intent, and you've proven that you're a force to be reckoned with on the world stage. I hope Real Madrid learns something, but probably not.</div>
