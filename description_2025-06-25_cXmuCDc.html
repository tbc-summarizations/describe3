  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic excuse for a group stage in the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League A.

<strong>Germany:</strong> No surprises here. A clinically efficient German side topping the group with ease. They demolished weak opposition like Bosnia. Conceding only 4 goals in 6 games speaks volumes about their defensive solidity, not to mention thrashing the likes of Hungary 5-0 and Bosnia 7-0 to prove themselves top of the table. Quarterfinals are well deserved but let's see if they can actually perform when it matters.

<strong>Netherlands:</strong> Second place is fine, but their performances were underwhelming. The Dutch side barely held on to win against Bosnia 5-2 and drew against Hungary 1-1, that is just pathetic. However they were able to hold the German to 2 draws and manage to get through the group stages, good enough. 

<strong>Hungary:</strong> Absolutely dreadful. One win, three draws, and a negative goal difference of -7. Their only win came against the already relegated Bosnia and Herzegovina, so that says it all. They'll be fighting for their lives in the relegation play-offs, and frankly, they deserve to go down.

<strong>Bosnia and Herzegovina:</strong> Where do I even begin? Zero wins, two draws, and a horrific goal difference of -13. They were the punching bag of the group, suffering humiliating defeats and barely managing to score a measly four goals throughout the entire campaign. Relegation is more than deserved, they have no place in League A with performances like this. They are simply trash and have no hope.</div>
