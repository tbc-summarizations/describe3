  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Croatia.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of the Croatian squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Dominik Livakovic:</strong> 7/10. Decent shot-stopper, but lacks the presence and distribution of top-tier keepers.
•   <strong>Ivica Ivusic:</strong> 5/10. A backup-level keeper, not someone who inspires confidence.
•   <strong>Dominik Kotarski:</strong> 4/10. Untested at the highest level, a gamble.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Josko Gvardiol:</strong> 9/10. World-class potential, already a rock at the back.
•   <strong>Josip Juranovic:</strong> 6/10. Solid, but unspectacular. Lacks the pace to truly excel.
•   <strong>Borna Barisic:</strong> 5/10. Prone to errors, not reliable enough.
•   <strong>Duje Caleta-Car:</strong> 4/10. A liability waiting to happen, clumsy and slow.
•   <strong>Josip Sutalo:</strong> 6/10. Promising, but still raw. Needs more experience.
•   <strong>Borna Sosa:</strong> 7/10. Good going forward, but questionable defensively.
•   <strong>Josip Stanisic:</strong> 6/10. Versatile, but not outstanding in any particular area.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Luka Modric:</strong> 9/10. Still a genius, but age is catching up.
•   <strong>Lovro Majer:</strong> 7/10. Creative and skillful, but inconsistent.
•   <strong>Mario Pasalic:</strong> 6/10. A hard worker, but lacks the quality to be a game-changer.
•   <strong>Nikola Vlasic:</strong> 5/10. Disappointing, hasn't lived up to expectations.
•   <strong>Mateo Kovacic:</strong> 8/10. Excellent dribbler, but lacks end product.
•   <strong>Luka Ivanusec:</strong> 6/10. Promising, but unproven.
•   <strong>Luka Sucic:</strong> 5/10. A long-term prospect, not ready for a major role.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ivan Perisic:</strong> 7/10. Experienced and versatile, but past his prime.
•   <strong>Andrej Kramaric:</strong> 7/10. A decent goalscorer, but not a top-class striker.
•   <strong>Bruno Petkovic:</strong> 5/10. Slow and predictable, struggles against good defenders.
•   <strong>Ante Budimir:</strong> 4/10. Not good enough for this level.
•   <strong>Marko Pjaca:</strong> 3/10. Injury-prone and ineffective.
•   <strong>Mislav Orsic:</strong> 6/10. A hardworking player, but lacks the quality to make a real impact.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong> 6.5/10.

<strong>Summary:</strong>

The team is heavily reliant on Modric, Gvardiol, and Kovacic. The defense has some weak links, and the attack lacks a genuine world-class striker. The squad has a good blend of experience and youth, but is lacking a bit in certain key areas. They might struggle against top-tier teams. Overall an average team.</div>
