  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these Geometry Dash Cup group stages with a brutally honest and detail-oriented analysis:

<strong>Group A:</strong>

•   <strong>Zoink (🇺🇸):</strong> Solid player, known for consistency. Should easily top this group given the competition.
•   <strong>Taiago (🇵🇹):</strong> Potentially decent, but not a major threat to Zoink. Second place is likely.
•   <strong>Superjavicon (🇪🇸):</strong> Highly unlikely to make it out of the group stage. Probably outclassed.
•   <strong>moliklee (🇲🇩):</strong> Almost certainly the weakest link in this group. Expect a quick exit.

<strong>Predicted Outcome:</strong>
1.  Zoink
2.  Taiago
3.  Superjavicon
4.  moliklee

<strong>Group B:</strong>

•   <strong>wPopoff (🇺🇸):</strong> Another American player with skill and experience. A strong contender for the top spot.
•   <strong>eastshark (🇪🇸):</strong> A decent player but will likely struggle to keep up with wPopoff.
•   <strong>Whizkid05 (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿):</strong> Average at best, not expected to advance.
•   <strong>ViperVenom95 (🇦🇺):</strong> Likely to be cannon fodder.

<strong>Predicted Outcome:</strong>
1.  wPopoff
2.  eastshark
3.  Whizkid05
4.  ViperVenom95

<strong>Group C:</strong>

•   <strong>Trick (🇺🇸):</strong> Known as a very skilled player. Top seed.
•   <strong>Alexander Saraf (🇷🇺):</strong> Can get lucky and sneak into second place but Trick will defeat them.
•   <strong>Laniakea (🇰🇷):</strong> Unknown threat, but probably not going to do much.
•   <strong>Doggie (🇺🇸):</strong> Is also an American player but is not a match for Trick.

<strong>Predicted Outcome:</strong>
1.  Trick
2.  Alexander Saraf
3.  Laniakea
4.  Doggie

<strong>Group D:</strong>

•   <strong>Netermind (🇺🇸):</strong> One of the strongest names in this list. Should dominate.
•   <strong>kloone (🇫🇮):</strong> A good player but no match for Netermind.
•   <strong>Kaza (🇷🇴):</strong> Highly doubtful they'll make it.
•   <strong>skzyl (🇺🇸):</strong> Unlikely to advance.

<strong>Predicted Outcome:</strong>
1.  Netermind
2.  kloone
3.  Kaza
4.  skzyl

<strong>Group E:</strong>

•   <strong>Thnnder (🇺🇸):</strong> Decent player, but may struggle to win.
•   <strong>iIiLaSeRiIi (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Another good player. May sneak a win over Thnnder.
•   <strong>SerVax (🇺🇦):</strong> Weakest of the group, will be eliminated.
•   <strong>Hqmy (🇺🇸):</strong> A relatively unknown player with high potential, expected to do well.

<strong>Predicted Outcome:</strong>
1.  Hqmy
2.  iIiLaSeRiIi
3.  Thnnder
4.  SerVax

<strong>Group F:</strong>

•   <strong>zLevii (🇳🇿):</strong> Unknown player, may be good.
•   <strong>Vorten (🇷🇺):</strong> Solid name but doesn't stand out.
•   <strong>Stefan Boss (🇷🇴):</strong> Unknown player, will perform badly.
