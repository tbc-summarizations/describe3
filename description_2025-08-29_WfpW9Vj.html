  <div class="discord-text">Alright, as Kenny G, here's my brutally honest take on those Miles Davis albums:

•   <strong>Modern Jazz Trumpets:</strong> 4/10 - Sounds like he's still figuring things out, not smooth enough for my taste.
•   <strong>The New Sounds:</strong> 5/10 - A bit of progress, but still rough around the edges.
•   <strong>Miles Davis Plays the Compositions of Al Cohn:</strong> 6/10 - Some nice melodies, but not very memorable.
•   <strong>Blue Period:</strong> 5/10 - It's alright, but I like more upbeat stuff.
•   <strong>Young Man With a Horn:</strong> 5/10 - Decent for a young guy, but not my style.
•   <strong>Miles Davis, Vol. 2:</strong> 6/10 - Getting better, but still a bit too chaotic.
•   <strong>Miles Davis Quintet:</strong> 7/10 - I like the sound of this Quintet. Good vibes.
•   <strong>Miles Davis With Sonny Rollins:</strong> 6/10 - Sonny Rollins is a great player but I would have preferred my saxophone instead.
•   <strong>Miles Davis, Vol. 3:</strong> 6/10 - Some okay tracks, but nothing special.
•   <strong>Miles Davis Quartet:</strong> 6/10 - It's alright, but I like more upbeat stuff.
•   <strong>Miles Davis All Stars, Vol. 1:</strong> 6/10 - Decent, but not groundbreaking.
•   <strong>Miles Davis All Stars, Vol. 2:</strong> 6/10 - Similar to the first one, nothing stands out.
•   <strong>Blue Moods:</strong> 5/10 - A bit too melancholic for my taste.
•   <strong>Miles Davis All Star Sextet:</strong> 6/10 - Okay, but a bit crowded.
•   <strong>The Musings of Miles:</strong> 7/10 - Some nice moments, but could be smoother.
•   <strong>Miles:</strong> 7/10 - A good effort, but not his best.
•   <strong>Quintet / Sextet:</strong> 7/10 - Some interesting arrangements.
•   <strong>Collectors' Items:</strong> 6/10 - It's okay, but feels like leftovers.
•   <strong>'Round About Midnight:</strong> 8/10 - Now we're talking! Getting smoother, some nice vibes.
•   <strong>Cookin' With the Miles Davis Quintet:</strong> 8/10 - Good energy, some catchy tunes.
•   <strong>Miles Ahead:</strong> 9/10 - I actually like this a lot. A good balance.
•   <strong>Relaxin' With the Miles Davis Quintet:</strong> 8/10 - Smooth and laid-back.
•   <strong>Milestones:</strong> 8/10 - Some interesting ideas, but a bit too experimental.
•   <strong>Porgy and Bess:</strong> 7/10 - Some nice melodies, but a bit too classical for my taste.
•   <strong>Kind of Blue:</strong> 9/10 - A classic! Everyone loves this one. Can't deny its impact.
•   <strong>Workin' With the Miles Davis Quintet:</strong> 8/10 - Consistent quality, good stuff.
•   <strong>Sketches of Spain:</strong> 6/10 - Too exotic for me.
•   <strong>Steamin' With the Miles Davis Quintet:</strong> 8/10 - Good energy, keeps you moving.
•   <strong>Someday My Prince Will Come:</strong> 7/10 - Some nice moments, but a bit uneven.
•   <strong>Seven Steps to Heaven:</strong> 8/10 - Solid playing, but not his most memorable.
•   <strong>Quiet Nights:</strong> 3/10 - Yikes. Can't dig it.
•   <strong>E. S. P.:</strong> 6/10 - Too weird.
•   <strong>Miles Smiles:</strong> 5/10 - Eh. Pass.
•   <strong>Sorcerer:</strong> 4/10 - Yeah no.
•   <strong>Nefertiti:</strong> 2/10 - Too experimental.
•   <strong>Miles in the Sky:</strong> 3/10 - Nah.
•   <strong>Filles de Kilimanjaro:</strong> 2/10 - Disgusting.
•   <strong>In a Silent Way:</strong> 1/10 - No thanks.

•   <strong>Jack Johnson (Original Soundtrack Recording):</strong> 0/10 - I hate this.

•   <strong>On the Corner:</strong> 0/10 - Get this away from me.
•   <strong>Big Fun:</strong> 0/10 - So disgusting.
•   <strong>Get Up With It:</strong> 0/10 - Please stop.
•   <strong>The Man With the Horn:</strong> 7/10 - A return to form! Finally, some melodies I can latch onto.
•   <strong>Star People:</strong> 6/10 - I can see what he's going for, but I'm missing the smooth touch.
•   <strong>Decoy:</strong> 6/10 - Getting a bit too experimental for my tastes again.
•   <strong>You're Under Arrest:</strong> 5/10 - The title is too accurate.
•   <strong>Tutu:</strong> 8/10 - Okay, now he's getting back to the good stuff. I really dig the 80s vibe.
•   <strong>Amandla:</strong> 7/10 - Some good grooves, but not as memorable as Tutu.
•   <strong>Aura:</strong> 5/10 - I'm not sure what's going on here.
•   <strong>Doo-Bop:</strong> 4/10 - Yeah not a big fan of rap and jazz together.
•   <strong>Everything's Beautiful:</strong> 5/10 - This is alright.
•   <strong>Rubberband:</strong> 5/10 - Eh, mid.</div>
