  <h1>Description for 220px-UEFA_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to drop some truth bombs on these World Cup Qualifier matches. I'm not holding back.

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Luxembourg 🇱🇺 vs. Germany 🇩🇪: 0-5</strong> Luxembourg is just going to get steamrolled. Germany's got way too much quality, and they'll want to rack up the goal difference.
•   <strong>Slovakia 🇸🇰 vs. Northern Ireland 🇬🇧: 2-1</strong> A scrappy affair. Slovakia's got a bit more going forward. Northern Ireland will fight, but they'll be outgunned.
•   <strong>Northern Ireland 🇬🇧 vs. Luxembourg 🇱🇺: 1-0</strong> A lucky win for Northern Ireland at home. Luxembourg is awful and can't score goals for shit.
•   <strong>Germany 🇩🇪 vs. Slovakia 🇸🇰: 3-0</strong> Germany's class will tell. Slovakia will put up a fight, but Germany's attack will break them down.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮 vs. Kosovo 🇽🇰: 2-0</strong> Slovenia's more organized and has better players. Kosovo is a mess.
•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 vs. Sweden 🇸🇪: 2-2</strong> A tight game. Sweden has some decent attacking talent, but Switzerland is solid all around.
•   <strong>Kosovo 🇽🇰 vs. Switzerland 🇨🇭: 0-3</strong> Switzerland will easily win this game because Kosovo can't defend for shit.
•   <strong>Sweden 🇸🇪 vs. Slovenia 🇸🇮: 1-1</strong> Another draw. Both teams are pretty evenly matched, and neither is a real powerhouse.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷 vs. Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: 1-0</strong> A dull game. Greece will play it tight, and Scotland lacks the creativity to break them down.
•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 vs. Belarus 🇧🇾: 4-0</strong> Denmark will destroy Belarus. No contest.
•   <strong>Belarus 🇧🇾 vs. Greece 🇬🇷: 0-2</strong> Greece's experience and defensive solidity will see them through. Belarus offers absolutely nothing.
•   <strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 vs. Denmark 🇩🇰: 1-2</strong> Denmark will edge it. They have more quality in key positions, and Scotland's defense will crack.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>Bulgaria 🇧🇬 vs. Georgia 🇬🇪: 1-1</strong> A dreadful game between two awful teams.
