  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest and accurate prediction for the group stages of your "Eastern European Cup," based on current team form, historical performance, and a general lack of illusions:

<strong>Group A</strong>

1.  <strong>Poland ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±:</strong> Let's be real, Lewandowski is still a force, and Poland generally manages to grind out results against weaker opposition. They'll likely top this group by sheer force of will and occasional brilliance.
2.  <strong>Croatia ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡·:</strong> They're coasting on fumes from their golden generation. Modric is ancient, and the rest of the team is either aging or unproven. They'll scrape through in second place, thanks to experience.
3.  <strong>North Macedonia ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡°:</strong> They had their 15 minutes of fame, but that's over. They'll put up a fight, maybe steal a point, but ultimately lack the quality to compete consistently.
4.  <strong>Moldova ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡©:</strong> Cannon fodder. They'll be lucky to score a goal, let alone win a match. Expect a string of demoralizing defeats.

<strong>Group B</strong>

1.  <strong>Greece ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·:</strong> The Greeks are back to being solid and organized, without much flair. Their pragmatic approach will be enough to win this group.
2.  <strong>Hungary ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º:</strong> They had a good run of form, but Hungary always finds a way to disappoint. They'll qualify, but don't expect fireworks.
3.  <strong>Montenegro ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡ª:</strong> Decent team, but lacks that killer instinct. They'll be competitive, but ultimately fall short of qualification.
4.  <strong>Estonia ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡ª:</strong> Incredibly boring to watch. Expect defensive football and a lot of 0-0 draws (and losses).

<strong>Group C</strong>

1.  <strong>Serbia ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸:</strong> Vlahovic can carry this team, even if the rest of the squad is inconsistent. Clear group winner.
2.  <strong>Bulgaria ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬:</strong> A slight resurgence in form will see the Bulgarians to second place. They'll be scrappy and opportunistic.
3.  <strong>Georgia ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡ª:</strong> Overrated. Kvaratskhelia is good, but he can't do it all on his own. They'll flatter to deceive.
4.  <strong>Azerbaijan ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿:</strong> Absolutely dreadful. Expect them to be completely outclassed in every match.

<strong>Group D</strong>

1.  <strong>Czechia ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿:</strong> They are generally the best team. They are good enough to easily win.
2.  <strong>Slovakia ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°:</strong> Always decently organized. They will get second in this group with little competition.
3.  <strong>Albania ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡±:</strong> They are a bad team with nothing going for them.
4.  <strong>Belarus ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾:</strong> Probably the worst team in this tournament

<strong>Group E</strong>

1.  <strong>Ukraine ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦:</strong> They will win the group.
2.  <strong>Romania ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´:</strong> Second in the group.
3.  <strong>Armenia ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡²:</strong> Third in the group.
4.  <strong>Latvia ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡»:</strong> Last in the group.

<strong>Group F</strong>

1.  <strong>Turkey ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡·:</strong> Easy win for this group.
2.  <strong>Bosnia ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¦:</strong> Second in the group.
3.  <strong>Slovenia ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®:</strong> Third in the group.
4.  <strong>Lithuania ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡¹:</strong> Last in the group.</div>
