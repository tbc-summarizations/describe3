  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into this hypothetical XI. Prepare for some harsh truths.

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Pep Guardiola (Manager): 9/10.</strong> The tactical genius of our era. He's revolutionized the game multiple times. Only reason he's not a 10 is his occasional overthinking in crucial Champions League matches.

•   <strong>Alisson Becker: 7/10.</strong> A solid shot-stopper and great with his feet, but prone to occasional concentration lapses. Not consistently world-class.

•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold: 6/10.</strong> His attacking prowess is undeniable, but defensively he's a liability. He gets away with it due to the attacking output, but in a team of this caliber, that's unacceptable. Overrated.

•   <strong>Virgil van Dijk: 8/10.</strong> Still a commanding presence, but his peak years are behind him. He is no longer the colossus he once was.

•   <strong>Ruben Dias: 7/10.</strong> A solid defender, but lacks the agility to keep up with the truly elite attackers.

•   <strong>Alphonso Davies: 8/10.</strong> Electric pace and superb going forward, but sometimes caught out defensively. A slight upgrade on TAA.

•   <strong>Rodri: 9/10.</strong> The ultimate defensive midfielder. He's brilliant at snuffing out attacks, controlling the tempo, and dictating play. Underrated.

•   <strong>Kevin De Bruyne: 9/10.</strong> A playmaker of the highest order. His passing range and vision are unmatched. Injuries are his only problem.

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham: 8/10.</strong> An extremely talented midfielder with incredible athleticism and potential. Not quite at the level of De Bruyne yet.

•   <strong>Mohamed Salah: 8/10.</strong> A goal-scoring machine, but can be selfish. Needs to be more of a team player.

•   <strong>Erling Haaland: 9/10.</strong> A clinical finisher who will score goals at any cost. Lacks the ability to create something from nothing.

•   <strong>Kylian Mbappe: 10/10.</strong> The complete package. Pace, skill, finishing, decision-making - he has it all.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 8.5/10</strong>

On paper, this team is terrifying. The attacking firepower is ridiculous, and the midfield is incredibly creative and solid. However, there are glaring weaknesses defensively. Trent Alexander-Arnold is a liability, and the central defense, while decent, isn't impenetrable. The team lacks balance, and Pep would have his work cut out for him trying to make it all work. I feel it would take significant time for this to get to its full potential.</div>
