  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of that Sporting CP starting XI:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Goalkeeper: Rui Silva (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6/10 - Decent shot-stopper, but prone to the occasional blunder. Not a top-tier keeper, but serviceable.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: Nuno Santos (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6.5/10 - A hard-working player, but lacks the quality of a top defender. Can get caught out defensively.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: GonÃ§alo InÃ¡cio (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 7.5/10 - One of the brighter prospects in the team. Solid defender with good potential, but still needs to develop consistency.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: Ousmane Diomande (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡®):</strong> 7/10 - Physically strong and aggressive defender. Can be a bit rash at times, needs to refine his decision-making.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: Georgios Vagiannidis (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·):</strong> 5/10 - A weak link in the defense. Lacks pace and technical ability. A liability against quality opposition.

â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Morten Hjulmand (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°):</strong> 8/10 - A key player in midfield. Excellent passer with great vision. Dictates the tempo of the game and protects the defense.

â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Hidemasa Morita (ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ):</strong> 6/10 - A decent player but not much more. Lacks the creativity to unlock defenses.

â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Maxi AraÃºjo (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾):</strong> 7/10 - A creative midfielder with a good eye for goal. Can be inconsistent, but has the potential to be a match-winner.

â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Pedro GonÃ§alves (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 8.5/10 - The star of the team. A clinical finisher with excellent technique. A constant threat to opposition defenses.

â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Conrad Harder (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°):</strong> 5/10 - Simply not good enough for a team with aspirations of challenging for the title. Offers very little in attack.

â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Francisco TrincÃ£o (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6.5/10 - A talented player but lacks the killer instinct in front of goal. A frustrating player to watch.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

4/10 - This starting XI has potential in some areas. But lacks real depth. The defense is the weakest area. If you are asking if this is one of the weaker squad, the answer is yes.</div>
