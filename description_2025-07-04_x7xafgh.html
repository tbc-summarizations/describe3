  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are 5 border changes that would make things interesting on this map, without being too outrageous:

1.  <strong>A United Ireland:</strong> The Republic of Ireland fully absorbs Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom, resolving a long-standing conflict. I think it's about time.
2.  <strong>Greater Albania:</strong> Albania, already enlarged, expands further into Western Macedonia, Kosovo, and parts of Montenegro, reflecting a shift in regional power dynamics and ethnic tensions.
3.  <strong>Kurdistan:</strong> The Kurdish region spanning parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran unites into its own nation. They deserve a land of their own.
4.  <strong>Nigeria Splits:</strong> Nigeria splits into three or four separate nations due to internal conflict and ethnic tensions. I think the state of Nigeria is far too fragile to last and it's destined to split.
5.  <strong>Greater Somalia:</strong> Somalia expands to incorporate parts of Djibouti, Kenya, and Ethiopia to become Greater Somalia.</div>
