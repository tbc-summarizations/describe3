  <h1>Description for top_10_fav_clubs.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my take on legends for each of those clubs:

•   <strong>Atyrau:</strong> Not going to lie, this team isn't exactly overflowing with global icons. Based on what info I can dig up, I'll go with <strong>Konstantin Zadorozhny</strong>. He seems to be one of their more consistent goalscorers in recent history.

•   <strong>Atlético Madrid:</strong> <strong>Luis Aragonés.</strong> No contest. He embodies the spirit of the club both as a player and a manager.

•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> <strong>Sergio Agüero</strong>. Their all-time leading scorer and a pivotal figure in their transformation into a dominant force.

•   <strong>AC Milan:</strong> <strong>Paolo Maldini</strong>. An absolute rock at the back, embodying the club's tradition of defensive excellence and longevity.

•   <strong>Beşiktaş:</strong> <strong>Süleyman Seba.</strong> More of an administrative legend. He was the president who shaped the modern era of Beşiktaş, and no player comes close to his impact.

•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> <strong>Franz Beckenbauer</strong>. <em>Der Kaiser</em>. Elegant, dominant, and a true icon of German football.

•   <strong>Qarabağ:</strong> <strong>Rashad Sadygov</strong>. A long-serving captain and defender who led them to multiple league titles and European appearances.

•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> <strong>Darijo Srna</strong>. A modern icon, the captain who led them through their most successful period, even during incredibly difficult circumstances.

•   <strong>Zenit St. Petersburg:</strong> <strong>Andrey Arshavin</strong>. Yeah, his time at Arsenal wasn't consistent, but he was electric for Zenit and a key figure in their UEFA Cup win.

•   <strong>Rangers:</strong> <strong>Ally McCoist.</strong> Top goal scorer and has a good history with club.</div>
