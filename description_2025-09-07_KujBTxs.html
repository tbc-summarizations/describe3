  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back. Here's the brutally honest assessment of the Georgian National Team, position by position:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Giorgi Mamardashvili (Liverpool): 9/10.</strong> No debate here. A genuine world-class talent who could be the difference between winning and losing.
•   <strong>Luka Gugeshashvili (PAOK): 5/10.</strong> Serviceable backup. Not someone I'd be confident with in a crucial game.
•   <strong>Davit Kereselidze (Dila Gori): 3/10.</strong> Playing domestically says it all. Doesn't inspire much confidence at the international level.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Saba Goglichidze (Udinese): 4/10.</strong> At Udinese but hasn't set Serie A alight. Likely a squad player.
•   <strong>Saba Khvadagiani (Maccabi Netanya): 4/10.</strong> Playing in Israel isn't exactly a badge of honor. A decent squad player, but nothing more.
•   <strong>Luka Lochoshvili (Nüremburg): 5/10.</strong> Decent enough for the 2. Bundesliga, but that's not saying much.
•   <strong>Guram Kashia (Slovan Bratislava): 6/10.</strong> An experienced veteran, but his best days are behind him. Likely past it at a high level.
•   <strong>Irakli Azarovi (Shakhtar Donetsk): 5/10.</strong> Shakhtar isn't what it used to be. Probably inconsistent, at best.
•   <strong>Giorgi Gocholeishvili (Hamburger SV): 6/10.</strong> Another 2. Bundesliga player. Nothing special.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Giorgi Kochorashvili (Sporting CP): 7/10.</strong> Should be doing well at Sporting, but that doesn't mean that it's enough to make it a real difference.
•   <strong>Anzor Mekvabishvili (Universitatea Craiova): 5/10.</strong> Romanian league? Hard pass. Likely very average.
•   <strong>Vladimer Mamuchashvili (Torpedo Kutaisi): 2/10.</strong> Domestic league again. A complete nobody at the international level.
•   <strong>Nika Gagnidze (Kolos Kovalivka): 4/10.</strong> Ukrainian league... needs improvement, no point.
•   <strong>Nodar Lominadze (Estoril): 5/10.</strong> Portugal is okay but there are many players here who can be better.
•   <strong>Otar Kakabadze (Cracovia): 5/10.</strong> Polish league screams mediocrity.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Paris Saint-Germain): 10/10.</strong> A genuine superstar and the only reason to watch this team. Can change any game on his own.
•   <strong>Zuriko Davitashvili (Saint-Étienne): 6/10.</strong> Ligue 2? Not a great sign. Probably inconsistent.
•   <strong>Saba Lobjanidze (Atlanta United): 6/10.</strong> MLS is improving, but still nowhere near the top level. Decent player, but limited impact at the international level.
•   <strong>Giorgi Kvernadze (Frosinone): 5/10.</strong> Serie A but no one knows who he is. That says it all. Probably a benchwarmer.
•   <strong>Giorgi Tsitaishvili (Metz): 5/10.</strong> Another Ligue 1 player with limited impact. Nothing special.
•   <strong>Georges Mikautadze (Villarreal): 5/10.</strong> La Liga but hasn't made a splash. Probably underwhelming.
•   <strong>Budu Zivzivadze (Heidenheim): 6/10.</strong> Okay for Bundesliga, but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Giorgi Guliashvili (Sarajevo): 3/10.</strong> Bosnian league? Seriously? A complete waste of space on the squad.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 5/10</strong>

This is a very average squad with one world-class player carrying them. The defense is weak, the midfield is uninspired, and the attack, besides Kvaratskhelia, lacks genuine quality. They'll struggle against any decent opposition. The only way they'll overachieve is if Kvaratskhelia is in absolutely peak form. Otherwise, expect them to be cannon fodder. Plain and simple.</div>
