  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's dissect this pathetic excuse for a qualifying group:

•   <strong>Bosnia and Herzegovina:</strong> Okay, Bosnia, I see you. Three wins is decent, but scoring only 4 goals in 3 games isn't exactly inspiring. Don't get complacent, those goals will dry up eventually.

•   <strong>Austria:</strong> Two games played and two wins is good, and a +5 goal difference suggests more dominance than Bosnia, but can they actually keep it up over a longer campaign? We'll see. Still, looks promising and I like how clean their results are.

•   <strong>Romania:</strong> Romania, you're a mess. +4 goal difference is promising but you've played 4 games and already lost twice? Do something.

•   <strong>Cyprus:</strong> Cyprus, I'm not even surprised. 3 goals scored and 4 allowed with one win against teams I'm sure they can't even defend against.

•   <strong>San Marino:</strong> Oh, San Marino, you exist to be humiliated, don't you? I almost feel bad for you, but 1 goal scored and 12 conceded is just sad. You make the other teams feel good about themselves. Pathetic.

Overall, a pretty mediocre group. Bosnia and Austria have a chance to compete here, but the rest are just filling spots. I'm not expecting any miracles from any of them, especially San Marino.</div>
