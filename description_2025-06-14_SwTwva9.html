  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the most brutally honest and accurate starting XI I can assemble from those nations, with a focus on current form, talent, and tactical fit. Forget soft takes – this is about winning.

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3 (Aggressive, Possession-Based)</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: </strong>Martin Dúbravka (Slovakia):
•   The only real option here. Dúbravka, when on form, is a very solid Premier League goalkeeper with command in the box. His shot-stopping ability is superior to any other potential option from these nations.

•   <strong>Right Back:</strong> Nélson Semedo (Portugal):
•   Semedo is a defensively sound player that can be an option in the attack. The options from all of these other countries are worse so this is an obvious decision.

•   <strong>Center Back:</strong> Pepe (Portugal):
•   Although old, Pepe is a great player. I don't need to explain why,

•   <strong>Center Back:</strong> Denis Hadžikadunić (Bosnia and Herzegovina):
•   Hadžikadunić is a solid choice, he plays for Hamburger SV in the 2. Bundesliga.

•   <strong>Left Back:</strong> Rúben Vinagre (Portugal):
•   Vinagre is a very solid player overall. I cannot lie. The other options aren't great.

•   <strong>Defensive Midfield:</strong> Stanislav Lobotka (Slovakia):
•   Lobotka is actually really good. He is the engine in the middle of the park and knows how to play.

•   <strong>Central Midfield:</strong> Pizzi (Portugal):
•   Pizzi is a very solid pick. A very underated player and this is a fair inclusion.

•   <strong>Central Midfield:</strong> Gerson Rodrigues (Luxembourg):
•   A really nice player that can do wonders. He is really good.

•   <strong>Right Wing:</strong> Ricardo Horta (Portugal):
•   Horta is a very very clinical finisher. He's a solid choice and works well in all the games he plays.

•   <strong>Center Forward:</strong> Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal):
•   He's called Cristiano Ronaldo and it's safe to say he's an automatic pick.

•   <strong>Left Wing:</strong> Hákon Haraldsson (Iceland):
•   Iceland's brightest talent, Haraldsson is quick, skillful, and direct. He can take on defenders and has an eye for goal.

<strong>Subs:</strong>
•   Anthony Moris (Luxembourg)
•   Stefan Savić (Austria)
•   Edin Džeko (Bosnia)

<strong>Manager:</strong> Roberto Martinez (Portugal):
Martinez is experienced and competent, and has demonstrated tactical flexibility.</div>
