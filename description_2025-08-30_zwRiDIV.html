  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are my brutally honest predictions for Matchday 4 of the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League, no holding back:

•   <strong>Slavia Prague 🇨🇿 0 - 3 Arsenal 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> Arsenal's attack is too clinical for a defensively weak Slavia. Expect a comfortable win, no surprises.

•   <strong>Napoli 🇮🇹 2 - 1 Eintracht Frankfurt 🇩🇪:</strong> A tight affair. Napoli's home advantage and superior midfield will give them the edge, though Frankfurt will make it a battle.

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid 🇪🇸 3 - 0 Union Saint-Gilloise 🇧🇪:</strong> Simeone's Atletico will suffocate Union. A professional, ruthless display from the Spanish side.

•   <strong>Bodø/Glimt 🇳🇴 1 - 2 Monaco 🇫🇷:</strong> Bodø/Glimt are tough at home, but Monaco's individual quality will shine through. A narrow, hard-fought win for the French side.

•   <strong>Juventus 🇮🇹 1 - 1 Sporting CP 🇵🇹:</strong> A cagey, tactical stalemate. Both teams are defensively solid, so expect few chances and a low-scoring draw.

•   <strong>Liverpool 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 2 - 2 Real Madrid 🇪🇸:</strong> A classic Champions League clash. Goals galore, with both teams' attacking prowess on full display. A draw feels inevitable.

•   <strong>Olympiacos 🇬🇷 1 - 0 PSV Eindhoven 🇳🇱:</strong> Olympiacos will make their home advantage count. A gritty, determined performance will see them grind out a narrow win.

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain 🇫🇷 3 - 1 Bayern Munich 🇩🇪:</strong> PSG's attacking trio will be too much for Bayern's aging defense. A statement win for the Parisians.

•   <strong>Tottenham 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 4 - 0 Copenhagen 🇩🇰:</strong> Spurs are far too strong, will blow Copenhagen away.

•   <strong>Pafos 🇨🇾 0 - 2 Villarreal 🇪🇸:</strong> Pafos are a terrible team. Villarreal's superior quality will guarantee a comfortable victory.

•   <strong>Qarabağ 🇦🇿 0 - 5 Chelsea 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> Chelsea will destroy their opponents, with them failing to be able to make any chances.

•   <strong>Ajax 🇳🇱 2 - 1 Galatasaray 🇹🇷:</strong> Ajax are a good team, that will be too much for Galatasaray to come back from after they score first.

•   <strong>Club Brugge 🇧🇪 1 - 3 Barcelona 🇪🇸:</strong> Club Brugge will manage to score due to their good team. But Barcelona are the far superior team, and will therefore win.

•   <strong>Inter Milan 🇮🇹 6 - 0 Kairat 🇰🇿:</strong> Inter Milan will steamroll their opponents, they are too strong.

•   <strong>Manchester City 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 2 - 0 Borussia Dortmund 🇩🇪:</strong> Manchester City are too experienced and their team will overpower Borussia Dortmund.

•   <strong>Newcastle United 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 1 - 1 Athletic Bilbao 🇪🇸:</strong> Newcastle United are far worse than they were. Athletic Bilbao will take the lead but Newcastle United will make a come back.

•   <strong>Marseille 🇫🇷 2 - 1 Atalanta 🇮🇹:</strong> Marseille will win through a late minute goal. The team has more drive than Atalanta.

•   <strong>Benfica 🇵🇹 2 - 2 Bayer Leverkusen 🇩🇪:</strong> A high intensity game where Bayer Leverkusen will comeback. A tie between these two teams is a fair result.</div>
