  <h1>Description for 1920px-Flag_of_France.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of France's 1998 World Cup-winning starting XI, both individually and as a team:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Fabien Barthez:</strong> 7 - Eccentric and prone to the occasional howler, but undeniably a good shot-stopper and a character. Not world-class, but dependable for France.

•   <strong>Lilian Thuram:</strong> 9 - Phenomenal defender. Strong, intelligent, and surprisingly capable going forward. Scored both goals in the semi-final against Croatia, which elevates him even higher.

•   <strong>Frank Leboeuf:</strong> 6 - Solid but unspectacular. Always a reliable presence, but definitely the weak link in the central defense pairing. A journeyman compared to Desailly.

•   <strong>Marcel Desailly:</strong> 9 - A rock. Strong, commanding, and fantastic in the air. A world-class defender who anchored the defense with authority. A true leader.

•   <strong>Bixente Lizarazu:</strong> 7.5 - A very good left-back. Energetic, intelligent defensively, and contributed to the attack. Consistent but not an all-time great.

•   <strong>Didier Deschamps:</strong> 8 - The water carrier. Not the flashiest player, but he did his job of protecting the back four and setting the tempo. A true captain and leader, even if his passing was at times basic.

•   <strong>Christian Karembeu:</strong> 5 - Surprising starter in the final. Hardworking, but limited technically. Often a liability in possession. Very strange selection.

•   <strong>Emmanuel Petit:</strong> 8.5 - A box-to-box midfielder with a great engine and a knack for scoring important goals. His goal in the final sealed the victory. Underrated.

•   <strong>Zinedine Zidane:</strong> 9.5 - The talisman. A genius with the ball at his feet. His two goals in the final were deserved. No player could control the ball as good as him.

•   <strong>Youri Djorkaeff:</strong> 7 - A decent player with good technical ability, but inconsistent. Tends to blow hot and cold. Never a truly top player.

•   <strong>Stéphane Guivarc'h:</strong> 3 - A donkey. Simply not good enough to be leading the line for a team of this caliber. No goals in the entire tournament and a passenger throughout.

<strong>Team Rating (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Overall Team:</strong> 9.5 - This was a team built on a solid defensive base, with world-class talent in midfield, and the genius of Zidane to provide the spark. They lacked a truly top striker, but their defensive solidity and midfield dominance more than made up for it. They may have been a little boring and negative at times, but they got the job done. Undeniably worthy World Cup winners.</div>
