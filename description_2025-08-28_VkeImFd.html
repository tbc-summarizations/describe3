  <div class="discord-text">Alright, mate. Let's have a go at these Prince albums, shall we? Here's how we at Mumford & Sons would rate 'em:

•   <strong>For You:</strong> 3/10. Bit too much fluff, not enough substance. Sounds a bit green.
•   <strong>Prince:</strong> 5/10. Gettin' a bit better, but still a bit too polished for our liking.
•   <strong>Dirty Mind:</strong> 7/10. Now we're talkin'! A bit of grit, a bit of soul. We like the rawness.
•   <strong>Controversy:</strong> 6/10. Good ideas, but doesn't quite stick the landing.
•   <strong>1999:</strong> 8/10. Catchy, energetic. This one's got some staying power.
•   <strong>Purple Rain:</strong> 9/10. A classic for a reason. Can't deny the power of this one.
•   <strong>Around the World in a Day:</strong> 4/10. Lost the plot a bit here, mate. A bit too psychedelic for us.
•   <strong>Parade (Music From the Motion Picture Under the Cherry Moon):</strong> 7/10. A bit quirky, but it's got its moments.
•   <strong>Sign "☮︎" the Times:</strong> 9/10. A sprawling masterpiece. This is Prince at his most ambitious.
•   <strong>Lovesexy:</strong> 5/10. A bit too focused on the, uh, "sensual" side of things for our tastes.
•   <strong>Batman:</strong> 3/10. A bit of a mess, innit? Doesn't really work as a Prince album.
•   <strong>Graffiti Bridge:</strong> 2/10. Oh dear. Where did it all go wrong?
•   <strong>Diamonds and Pearls:</strong> 6/10. A bit of a return to form, but still a bit too slick.
•   <strong>O(+> \[Love Symbol]:</strong> 4/10. Confused, overblown, and a bit silly.
•   <strong>Come:</strong> 5/10. Dark, but not in a good way. A bit too brooding.
•   <strong>The Black Album:</strong> 8/10. Raw, funky, and full of attitude. This is the stuff!
•   <strong>The Gold Experience:</strong> 7/10. A bit patchy, but some real gems on here.
•   <strong>Chaos and Disorder:</strong> 6/10. A bit of a throwaway, but still has some charm.
•   <strong>Emancipation:</strong> 5/10. Too long, too unfocused. Needed a good edit.
•   <strong>Crystal Ball:</strong> 3/10. Overwhelming and self-indulgent.
•   <strong>The Truth:</strong> 7/10. Stripped-down and acoustic. We appreciate the simplicity.
•   <strong>The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale:</strong> 5/10. A bit of a mixed bag. Some good stuff, some filler.
•   <strong>Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic:</strong> 4/10. A bit dated and generic.
•   <strong>The Rainbow Children:</strong> 2/10. Pretentious and hard to get into.
•   <strong>One Nite Alone... Solo Piano and Voice by Prince:</strong> 8/10. Haunting and beautiful. Shows off his incredible talent.
•   <strong>Xpectation:</strong> 1/10. Dreadful, just dreadful.
•   <strong>N·E·W·S:</strong> 1/10. Completely unlistenable.
•   <strong>Musicology:</strong> 7/10. A solid return. A bit more mature and soulful.
•   <strong>The Slaughterhouse: Trax From the NPG Music Club - Volume 2:</strong> 3/10. For the die-hards only.
•   <strong>The Chocolate Invasion: Trax From the NPG Music Club - Volume 1:</strong> 3/10. More of the same.
•   <strong>3121:</strong> 6/10. A bit of a party album. Fun, but not particularly deep.
•   <strong>Planet Earth:</strong> 5/10. A bit bland and uninspired.
•   <strong>LOtUSFLOW3R:</strong> 4/10. Meandering and unfocused.
•   <strong>MPLSoUND:</strong> 7/10. A decent effort. Shows he's still got it.
•   <strong>20Ten:</strong> 5/10. Nothing special, but not terrible.
•   <strong>PLECTRUMELECTRUM:</strong> 4/10. Doesn't really capture the energy of 3rdEyeGirl.
•   <strong>Art Official Age:</strong> 6/10. A bit more experimental, but still accessible.
•   <strong>HITNRUN Phase One:</strong> 7/10. Gritty and modern. A welcome surprise.
•   <strong>HITNRUN Phase Two:</strong> 6/10. Not as strong as the first, but still decent.
•   <strong>Piano & A Microphone 1983:</strong> 8/10. Intimate and revealing. A must-hear for fans.
•   <strong>Welcome 2 America:</strong> 7/10. Relevant and thought-provoking. A good way to end his career.

There you have it, mate. That's our brutally honest take on Prince's discography. Hope it's what you were after. Cheers!</div>
