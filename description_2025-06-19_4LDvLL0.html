  <h1>Description for 81.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the Kazakhstan national football team squad, based on the info you provided:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Stas Pokatilov (Sabah):</strong> 6/10. Solid experience with a decent number of clean sheets, but playing in Azerbaijan isn't exactly top-tier competition. He's probably reliable but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Bekkhan Shaizada (Ordabasy):</strong> 4/10. Clean sheet numbers are low. Probably not a starter-quality keeper.
•   <strong>Aleksandr Zarutskiy (Kairat):</strong> 5/10. Slightly better than Shaizada, but still nothing special.
•   <strong>Mukhammedzhan Seisen (Astana):</strong> 5.5/10. The youngest of the bunch, which <em>might</em> indicate potential, but his stats are nothing to write home about.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Nuraly Alip (Zenit):</strong> 7/10. Playing for Zenit is a plus, showing he has some quality. His goal/assist numbers are whatever for a CB. Probably the best defender in the squad.
•   <strong>Adilbek Zhumakhanov (Elimay):</strong> 4/10. Young, but the stats are poor. Needs time to develop, if he ever does.
•   <strong>Sergei Malyi (Ordabasy):</strong> 5/10. At 35, he's likely past his prime. Decent goal/assist numbers for a CB, but playing in Kazakhstan lowers the value of that.
•   <strong>Yan Vorogovskiy (Astana):</strong> 6/10. Okayish numbers for a fullback. Might be a decent attacking outlet.
•   <strong>Sultanbek Astanov (Ordabasy):</strong> 5/10. Mediocre. Nothing stands out.
•   <strong>Marat Bystrov (Astana):</strong> 4/10. Low numbers for an attacking fullback, and he's getting old.
•   <strong>Erkin Tapalov (Kairat):</strong> 4/10. Similar to Bystrov, nothing special.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Islambek Kuat (Zhenis):</strong> 6/10. Decent numbers for a defensive midfielder. Might provide some steel in midfield.
•   <strong>Almas Tyulyubay (Elimay):</strong> 3/10. Those are awful numbers. Probably just a squad filler.
•   <strong>Georgiy Zhukov (Puszcza Niepolomice):</strong> 6.5/10. Playing in Poland is a slight plus. Okay numbers, probably a decent passer.
•   <strong>Nauryzbek Zhagorov (Tobol):</strong> 5/10. Unimpressive.
•   <strong>Murodzhon Khalmatov (Ordabasy):</strong> 5.5/10. Young, but his stats aren't amazing. Might have some potential.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Maksim Samorodov (Akhmat Grozny):</strong> 7/10. Playing in Russia is a plus, and the goal/assist numbers are pretty good for a winger. Probably one of the better players.
•   <strong>Aleksandr Zuev (Tobol):</strong> 6/10. Decent numbers, but playing in Kazakhstan lowers the impact.
•   <strong>Elkhan Astanov (Astana):</strong> 5.5/10. Average.
•   <strong>Aliyar Mukhammed (Okzhetpes):</strong> 4/10. Bad numbers.
•   <strong>Galymzhan Kenzhebek (Kosice):</strong> 5.5/10. Playing in Slovakia isn't great. Okayish numbers, but nothing special.
•   <strong>Islam Chesnokov (Tobol):</strong> 6.5/10. Good numbers for a winger, but again, it's in Kazakhstan.
•   <strong>Dauren Zhumat (Okzhetpes):</strong> 6/10. Not bad.
•   <strong>Dastan Satpaev (Kairat):</strong> 6/10. 16 years old is alarming. Against grown men? He is getting absolutely cooked alive every match. I'm not saying he can't be good in the future, as he does show some potential.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>4.5/10</strong>.

This squad looks seriously weak. There's a distinct lack of quality players playing in top leagues. Most of the players are stuck in the Kazakhstan league, and the few who play abroad aren't exactly lighting up the world. There's a worrying lack of creativity, pace, and overall talent. This team would struggle against any decent international opponent. The defense looks leaky, the midfield lacks bite, and the attack is toothless.</div>
