<strong>My Opinions:</strong>

•   <strong>Offensive Material:</strong> Albums by R. Kelly, Armpit Cunt, and others with explicit or disturbing content are automatically on this list. There's no artistic merit that can excuse blatant offensiveness.
•   <strong>Musical Incompetence:</strong> Many of these artists lack basic musical skill, creating noise that's unpleasant and pointless.
•   <strong>Self-Serving and Unaware:</strong> Artists like Tom MacDonald and certain YouTubers release music that's more about self-promotion than actual art, and the lack of self-awareness is painful to witness.
•   <strong>Cash Grabs:</strong> Kidz Bop is a prime example of a soulless commercial product disguised as music.
