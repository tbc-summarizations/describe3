  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into this list. I'm not holding back.

•   <strong>Aphex Twin</strong> - <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em> - Solid choice. It's a foundational electronic album. I agree with this one.

•   <strong>Black Sabbath</strong> - <em>Paranoid</em> - Obvious choice, and a good one. Can't argue with <em>Paranoid</em> as their best.

•   <strong>Charles Mingus</strong> - <em>The Black Saint and The Sinner Lady</em> - Absolutely. A masterpiece of avant-garde jazz. Good pick.

•   <strong>Death Grips</strong> - <em>Jenny Death</em> - It's a strong contender, but I think <em>The Money Store</em> is slightly better. The energy is just relentless.

•   <strong>Eminem</strong> - <em>The Marshall Mathers LP</em> - Correct. Peak Slim Shady. Controversial and brilliant.

•   <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong> - <em>In The Wee Small Hours</em> - A classic for a reason. Can't disagree.

•   <strong>Gorillaz</strong> - <em>Demon Days</em> - Yep, it's their most cohesive and iconic album.

•   <strong>Have A Nice Life</strong> - <em>Deathconsciousness</em> - Depressing, bleak, and powerful. I concur.

•   <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> - <em>Powerslave</em> - Undisputed. Peak Maiden, killer tracks from start to finish.

•   <strong>Joy Division</strong> - <em>Unknown Pleasures</em> - A must. A fantastic album!

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> - <em>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers</em> - Disagree. Good album but <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> is his magnum opus. Lyrically and musically, it's just on another level.

•   <strong>Linkin Park</strong> - <em>Hybrid Theory</em> - It's their most impactful, I'll give you that.

•   <strong>MF DOOM</strong> - <em>Madvillainy</em> - Legendary. No arguments here.

•   <strong>Nirvana</strong> - <em>Nevermind</em> - So overplayed, but still their best. I wish people would explore <em>In Utero</em> more, but <em>Nevermind</em> changed music.

•   <strong>OutKast</strong> - <em>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</em> - Audacious and sprawling. This is correct.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd</strong> - <em>Wish You Were Here</em> - Perfect pick. A concept album that still resonates.

•   <strong>Queen</strong> - <em>A Night At The Opera</em> - I agree. <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> alone makes it a legendary album, but the rest is solid too.

•   <strong>Radiohead</strong> - <em>Kid A</em> - This is a good pick.

•   <strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong> - <em>Illinois</em> - Correct. A sprawling, ambitious folk-pop masterpiece.

•   <strong>The Beatles</strong> - <em>Abbey Road</em> - Yeah, it's their most polished and iconic. Good choice.

•   <strong>USHER</strong> - <em>Confessions</em> - I agree.

•   <strong>Vader</strong> - <em>Litany</em> - A total death metal onslaught. Cannot disagree.

•   <strong>Ween</strong> - <em>Quebec</em> - Absolutely. Ween at their weirdest and best.

•   <strong>Xiu Xiu</strong> - <em>A Promise</em> - Disturbing and unforgettable. Definitely their peak.

•   <strong>Yes</strong> - <em>Close To The Edge</em> - Agree. Peak progressive rock.

•   <strong>Zach Bryan</strong> - <em>Zach Bryan</em> - It's not their best. I think <em>American Heartbreak</em> is much better.</div>
