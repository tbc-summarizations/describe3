  <div class="discord-text">Alright, aight, check it, here's the Vanilla Ice take on these Nas albums, straight up, no chaser:

•   <strong>Illmatic:</strong> 10/10. Yo, this is that lyrical ice, baby! Nas flows so smooth, it's like... well, like Vanilla Ice on a freshly Zambonied rink! Classic status, no doubt.

•   <strong>It Was Written:</strong> 8/10. Solid, but not quite as groundbreaking as <em>Illmatic</em>. Still, got some bangers that'll make you wanna bust a move, word.

•   <strong>I Am...:</strong> 6/10. Gettin' a little commercial, maybe? Some tracks still hit, but overall, feels like Nas was tryin' too hard to chase that mainstream dough.

•   <strong>Nastradamus:</strong> 3/10. Whoa, this album is not good, this is like the worst thing I've heard. Nas was spitting mid verses, the production was questionable.

•   <strong>Stillmatic:</strong> 8/10. Yo, he came back strong! Like, a resurgence, you feel me? Nas remindin' everyone why he's a legend, yeah.

•   <strong>God's Son:</strong> 6/10. Decent, but inconsistent. A few bangers for sure, but feels like it could've been tighter.

•   <strong>Street's Disciple:</strong> 5/10. Double album? Dude, come on! Too much filler, not enough killer.

•   <strong>Hip Hop Is Dead:</strong> 7/10. Controversial title, but some dope tracks. Nas stirrin' the pot, which I can respect, yo.

•   <strong>Untitled:</strong> 6/10. I understand he's trying to stay relevant, but his name is still Nas and he ain't in the 90s so he can't relate to the youth, like bro who even is he.

•   <strong>Distant Relatives:</strong> 7/10. Nas and Damian Marley, yo? Weird combo, but it kinda works! A unique vibe.

•   <strong>Life is Good:</strong> 7/10. Good album, some lyrical heat, but I don't feel good listening to it. The message is there but it doesn't hit as hard.

•   <strong>NASIR:</strong> 4/10. Kanye production? Shoulda been better. Felt rushed and incomplete.

•   <strong>King's Disease:</strong> 7/10. Hit-Boy production? I like this album a lot because it is more coherent than his last few albums.

•   <strong>King’s Disease II:</strong> 8/10. Even better than the first <em>King's Disease</em>. Nas keeps it real, and Hit-Boy brings the heat.

•   <strong>Magic:</strong> 8/10. Nas spits some of the most elite verses on this album, I love his lyrical genius

•   <strong>King's Disease III:</strong> 7/10. Nas brings the same energy from the other two, but I feel that this album is lacking something from the others, still a good album.

•   <strong>Magic 2:</strong> 7/10. Another Magic album with some more lyrical heat, I dig this one!

•   <strong>Magic 3:</strong> 8/10. I feel like this album has a great tone, I really enjoy the vibe that he has with these.</div>
