  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's stir up some trouble with these minor nations:

1.  <strong>Trinidad and Tobago vs. Guyana:</strong> A dispute over offshore oil rights leads to escalating tensions and a brief naval skirmish, followed by limited incursions into each other's territory. Guyana will win, but it will be a close fight. 
2.  <strong>Transit Government of Yemen vs. Somaliland:</strong> Somaliland sees an opportunity to establish a foothold in the Horn of Africa, leading to a quick but bloody conflict along the coast. Somaliland wins.
3.  <strong>Djibouti vs. Eritrea:</strong> Long-simmering border disputes and accusations of supporting rebel groups result in open warfare. Eritrea will win but suffer heavy casualties.
4.  <strong>Equatorial Guinea vs. Gabon:</strong> A power struggle over control of the Rio Muni region, rich in oil reserves, erupts into conflict. Gabon wins, taking a fair bit of territory.
5.  <strong>Bhutan vs. Arunachal Pradesh (India):</strong> Border disputes over contested territories lead to skirmishes, with India (controlling Arunachal Pradesh) initially underestimating Bhutan's resolve. Bhutan wins and takes some land, as India does not care about that region.</div>
