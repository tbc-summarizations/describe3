  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the Imagine Dragons take on those Black Country, New Road albums:

•   <strong>For the First Time:</strong> 4/10. It's... trying to be epic, but it's missing the stadium-sized hooks. Needs more energy, less meandering. Sounds like the kind of thing you play in a coffee shop, not a sold-out arena.

•   <strong>Ants From Up There:</strong> 6/10. Okay, there's something here. Some catchy moments, a few parts that could build into something huge, but it still feels unfinished. Needs a good producer to come in and give it that extra push.

•   <strong>Live at Bush Hall:</strong> 3/10. Live albums are supposed to capture the energy of the crowd. This sounds like background music. Where's the fire? Where's the passion?

•   <strong>Forever Howlong:</strong> 1/10. Never heard of this album, and judging from the other albums, I don't think I ever will. If it has to do with those other bands I won't like it.</div>
