  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect Astana's Champions League campaign with the brutal honesty it deserves.

<strong>League Phase:</strong>

•   <strong>Matchday 1: Astana 1-2 Basel:</strong> A home loss to start? Pathetic. Conceding to Basel at home is a sign of weakness from the outset. <strong>Rating: 2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 2: Copenhagen 3-3 Astana:</strong> A draw away isn't the worst, but conceding three goals to Copenhagen is embarrassing. Shows a defensive liability. <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 3: Astana 0-1 Lyon:</strong> Another home loss, this time to Lyon. Zero goals scored indicates a lack of attacking threat. Simply not good enough. <strong>Rating: 1/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 4: Paris Saint-Germain 0-1 Astana:</strong> I'll be fair, this is a surprisingly good result. A win against PSG, even away, is commendable. <strong>Rating: 8/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 5: Astana 1-0 APOEL:</strong> Barely scraping a win against APOEL at home? Hardly impressive. They should be dominating such opponents. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 6: Dynamo Moscow 0-1 Astana:</strong> Another away win, but against Dynamo Moscow? Still not a top-tier opponent. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 7: Astana 0-1 Lille:</strong> Yet another home loss. Losing to Lille at home is unacceptable. Shows a real problem with home form and consistency. <strong>Rating: 0/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 8: Real Madrid 2-2 Astana:</strong> Okay, I'll admit, a draw against Real Madrid, especially away, is a significant achievement. A moment of brilliance amidst mediocrity. <strong>Rating: 9/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 9: Astana 0-1 Olympiacos:</strong> Another home defeat, this time to Olympiacos. At this point, they're just giving away points. <strong>Rating: 0/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 10: Gent 1-2 Astana:</strong> A narrow win against Gent away from home. Not particularly impressive, but a win is a win. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 11: Astana 3-2 Benfica:</strong> A home win against Benfica? That's unexpected. Shows they can perform when they want to, but consistency is still an issue. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matchday 12: Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Astana:</strong> A surprising win against Tottenham away. They seem to have a knack for pulling off upsets. <strong>Rating: 8/10</strong>

<strong>Overall League Phase:</strong>

Qualifying for the knockout stage is a bit of a miracle considering their inconsistent performances. They have moments of brilliance interspersed with terrible home losses. 6 wins, 2 draws, 4 losses is okay and the overall score is okay. <strong>Overall League Phase Rating: 6/10</strong>

<strong>Round of 32:</strong>

•   <strong>Real Madrid 0-1 Astana:</strong> Beating Real Madrid <em>again</em>, this time away in the knockout stage? That's genuinely impressive. Credit where it's due. <strong>Rating: 9/10</strong>

<strong>Round of 16:</strong>

•   <strong>Astana 2-2 Paris Saint-Germain (PSG wins 3-2 on penalties):</strong> A draw against PSG at home is decent, but losing on penalties is a heartbreaker. Still, reaching the Round of 16 is further than anyone expected. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Campaign Rating:</strong>

Astana's Champions League campaign is a bizarre mix of shocking wins against top teams and embarrassing losses against weaker opponents. They are the definition of inconsistent, but they somehow managed to overachieve by reaching the Round of 16.

<strong>Overall Campaign Rating: 6/10</strong></div>
