  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I, Kid Rock, would rate those Marvin Gaye albums. Keep in mind, I like my music rowdy and real, not always smooth and sappy. 

•   <strong>The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye:</strong> 4/10 - Too much of that old-school crooner stuff for my taste.
•   <strong>That Stubborn Kinda' Fellow:</strong> 6/10 - Starting to get a bit more grit, but still needs more beer and less wine.
•   <strong>When I'm Alone I Cry:</strong> 3/10 - Pass. I ain't crying, I'm partying.
•   <strong>Together (with Mary Wells):</strong> 5/10 - Duets ain't always my thing, but it's alright.
•   <strong>Hello Broadway:</strong> 2/10 - Broadway? Get outta here.
•   <strong>How Sweet It Is to Be Loved by You:</strong> 6/10 - Catchy, I'll give him that.
•   <strong>A Tribute to the Great Nat King Cole:</strong> 1/10 - Stick to your own style, man.
•   <strong>Moods of Marvin Gaye:</strong> 5/10 - Depends on my mood, and usually it ain't this smooth.
•   <strong>Take 2 (with Kim Weston):</strong> 4/10 - More duets, whatever.
•   <strong>United (with Tammi Terrell):</strong> 6/10 - Okay, Tammi's got some fire.
•   <strong>You're All I Need (with Tammi Terrell):</strong> 7/10 - This is getting good.
•   <strong>In The Groove:</strong> 7/10 - Gettin' funky, now we're talkin'.
•   <strong>M.P.G.:</strong> 8/10 - Solid, can't complain.
•   <strong>Easy:</strong> 6/10 - "Easy" listening, I guess.
•   <strong>That's the Way Love Is:</strong> 7/10 - Soulful, but I ain't fallin' in love anytime soon.
•   <strong>What's Going On:</strong> 10/10 - Now this is a masterpiece. Real, raw, and speaks to the soul.
•   <strong>Let's Get It On:</strong> 9/10 - Risky, but I respect it.
•   <strong>Diana & Marvin:</strong> 4/10 - Diana Ross? Eh.
•   <strong>I Want You:</strong> 7/10 - Alright, Marvin.
•   <strong>Here, My Dear:</strong> 3/10 - Divorce album? Nah, man.
•   <strong>In Our Lifetime:</strong> 6/10 - Passable.
•   <strong>Midnight Love:</strong> 8/10 - He's back!
•   <strong>Dream of a Lifetime:</strong> 5/10 - Posthumous stuff is always weird.
•   <strong>Romantically Yours:</strong> 3/10 - Too sappy for this old rocker.
•   <strong>Vulnerable:</strong> 2/10 - Vulnerable? Not what I want in my music.
•   <strong>You're The Man:</strong> 6/10 - It's alright, I guess.

There you have it. Some gold, some garbage, but that's music for ya. Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy</div>
