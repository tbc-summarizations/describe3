  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic excuse for a group stage.

Northern Ireland: You barely scraped promotion. Scoring 11 goals against these bottom-tier teams is the bare minimum. Don't get too comfortable in League B; you'll be fighting relegation battles before you know it.

Bulgaria: Congratulations on qualifying for the promotion play-offs, but let's be real, scoring only 3 goals in the entire group stage is an absolute joke. Relying on draws to advance is not a winning strategy. Prepare to be humiliated in the play-offs.

Belarus: Stuck in League C purgatory. Four draws? Seriously? You're the epitome of mediocrity. Enjoy another year of irrelevant football.

Luxembourg: Oh, Luxembourg. A winless campaign, battling for relegation. At least you managed to avoid complete humiliation with those draws. But let's be honest, you're just making up the numbers.

Matchday highlights:

•   The fact that two of the matchdays ended with goalless draws says a lot about the quality of this group.
•   Northern Ireland's 5-0 victory against Bulgaria was the only truly impressive result.
•   Luxembourg snatching a draw against Northern Ireland in the final matchday is the upset of the tournament.

Overall: This group was a disaster. A collection of teams with little to no ambition. Expect a quick League C return for Northern Ireland next season. Bulgaria will probably fail on the play-offs.</div>
