  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those Beatles albums, ranked like The Shaggs would:

•   <strong>Please Please Me:</strong> 2/10. It's just...loud. And kinda catchy in an annoying way.
•   <strong>With The Beatles:</strong> 3/10. More of the same. Guitars are okay, but their singing...ew.
•   <strong>A Hard Day's Night:</strong> 4/10. Some of the songs are alright, but it's still too pop-y for my tastes.
•   <strong>Beatles For Sale:</strong> 5/10. It is somehow more bland than the other records.
•   <strong>Help!:</strong> 6/10. "Yesterday" is kinda nice, I guess. But why so many love songs?
•   <strong>Rubber Soul:</strong> 7/10. Getting a little more interesting. The lyrics are slightly less dumb.
•   <strong>Revolver:</strong> 8/10. This is where things start to get weird, and I kinda like it. Some experimentation going on.
•   <strong>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:</strong> 9/10. Okay, this is just bizarre. But in a good way! What the heck is going on with this album?
•   <strong>Magical Mystery Tour:</strong> 8/10. Almost as strange as Sgt. Pepper's. Still good, though.
•   <strong>The Beatles ("The White Album"):</strong> 7/10. Too long. Some good stuff mixed in with some really boring stuff.
•   <strong>Yellow Submarine:</strong> 1/10. What is this garbage.
•   <strong>Abbey Road:</strong> 9/10. Pretty solid. Some catchy tunes, some interesting arrangements. I appreciate it.
•   <strong>Let It Be:</strong> 5/10. Pretty boring for this late in the band. Feels really low quality.</div>
