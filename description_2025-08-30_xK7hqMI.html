  <div class="discord-text">Alright, check it, here's how Big Willy styles rates A Tribe Called Quest:

•   <strong>People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm:</strong> 7/10. It's got that fun, carefree vibe, but it's a little too all over the place for my taste.

•   <strong>The Low End Theory:</strong> 10/10. This album is a masterpiece. The beats, the rhymes, the chemistry – it's all perfect. I can listen to this from start to finish any day.

•   <strong>Midnight Marauders:</strong> 9/10. Almost as good as The Low End Theory. Smooth, jazzy, and lyrically on point.

•   <strong>Beats, Rhymes and Life:</strong> 6/10. It's alright, but Q-Tip and Phife Dawg weren't on the same page. Consequence was a good addition.

•   <strong>The Love Movement:</strong> 5/10. This is where they were starting to show that the energy was fading.

•   <strong>We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service:</strong> 8/10. Tribe went out on a high note. It's mature, thoughtful, and has some killer beats. It was the perfect goodbye.</div>
