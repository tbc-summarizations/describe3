  <h1>Description for 20250826_031227.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's my brutally honest rating of those "hardest physically possible" Geometry Dash levels based on how good I think they are:

•   <strong>Cant Let Go (Old) - RobTop:</strong> 0/10. It's RobTop's level, it's garbage. Don't act like it's good.

•   <strong>The First - Clatchet:</strong> 1/10. The fact that it is called "The First" is really fucking cringe. And it's just some ass challenge.

•   <strong>My First Level - Matty:</strong> 0/10. More cringe level names from matty.

•   <strong>Fast Dead - Alienware:</strong> 2/10. Trash.

•   <strong>The first 3 Trials - CarbonELITE:</strong> 4/10. It is a good challenge but why is it called "the first 3 Trials" It is not original at all.

•   <strong>help - yes man:</strong> 0/10. Name is really fucking stupid.

•   <strong>hard1 - jackey:</strong> 0/10. Even more trash.

•   <strong>xy - QRS:</strong> 2/10. Fucking garbage challenge

•   <strong>Level 5 - Matty:</strong> 0/10. Another matty level name, cringe as hell.

•   <strong>F - Player:</strong> 0/10. Stupid ass name.

•   <strong>Q - Inq:</strong> 0/10. Stupid as hell name.

•   <strong>To the Grave - Darnoc2:</strong> 0/10. It looks like hell.

•   <strong>cave adventure - gomchi:</strong> 0/10. Just an awful level.

•   <strong>Leap of faith - GW Zac:</strong> 0/10. Looks like trash.

•   <strong>demons time machine - bbddee:</strong> 0/10. It looks like complete trash.

•   <strong>The Hell zone - Sohn0924:</strong> 0/10. Looks awful.

•   <strong>The Hell World - Sohn0924:</strong> 0/10. Name is awful and looks like hell.

•   <strong>Atlantis - MaJackO:</strong> 2/10. It looks bad.

•   <strong>Element 111 Rg - DarkX:</strong> 0/10. Awful and bad name.

•   <strong>SARY NEVER CLEAR (Old) - Optic Sunflow:</strong> 0/10. It looks so awful.

•   <strong>Silent clubstep (Unnerfed) - TheRealSailent:</strong> 7/10. At least it's a classic.

•   <strong>Necrohol of Knights - EsisOfficial:</strong> 5/10. Overrated as hell.

•   <strong>sailent clubstar - TheRealSailent:</strong> 5/10. Awful level and awful name.

•   <strong>realm of bloodshadow (Unnerfed) - gdmiracle:</strong> 3/10. Another trash level.

•   <strong>Silent Circles (Unnerfed) - Cyrillic:</strong> 8/10. Another classic level.

•   <strong>Divine Geometry - Cyrillic:</strong> 9/10. This is probably Cyrillic's best level.

•   <strong>BtSiK Silent - Convindix:</strong> 3/10. Trash.

•   <strong>Shatter2041 Silent - Convindix:</strong> 3/10. Awful looking.

•   <strong>S Miller Never Clear (Unnerfed) - Wunjo:</strong> 0/10. Awful as hell.

•   <strong>Nessus - skubb:</strong> 2/10. It looks awful.

•   <strong>PPLLlife - Roxiiiiii:</strong> 1/10. Name is awful as hell.

•   <strong>Touching Grass - Typexleta:</strong> 0/10. Cringe name.

•   <strong>I miss HLL (Unbuffed) - VanyaM1:</strong> 0/10. Who cares.
