  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these Round of 16 results with the honesty they deserve:

<strong>Paris Saint-Germain 🇫🇷 5-1 PSV Eindhoven 🇳🇱:</strong>

•   Total domination. PSV never stood a chance. You can see that PSG wanted that European trophy and the money that comes with it.

<strong>Atletico Madrid 🇪🇸 1-2 Juventus 🇮🇹:</strong>

•   Atletico showing a lack of creativity when it comes to scoring goals. It's a shame. Juventus was just a tad bit sharper. They probably got lucky though.

<strong>Barcelona 🇪🇸 4-2 Bayern Munich 🇩🇪:</strong>

•   Bayern is a joke, what has happened to them? You used to fear them, but now they are just fodder for the stronger teams. This is just the start for Barcelona.

<strong>Maccabi Tel Aviv 🇮🇱 3-7 Lyon 🇫🇷:</strong>

•   Lyon woke up in the second leg. Someone must have given them a serious talking-to. Maccabi punching above their weight in the first leg, but the reality kicked in.

<strong>Shakhtar Donetsk 🇺🇦 1-4 Manchester United 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong>

•   As expected. Manchester United just outclasses Shakhtar in every department. No surprises here.

<strong>Galatasaray 🇹🇷 4-2 Manchester City 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong>

•   HUGE UPSET! City getting embarrassed AGAIN in Europe? What are they doing with all that money? Galatasaray, you have my respect for now. But you better back it up!

<strong>Roma 🇮🇹 1-2 Arsenal 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong>

•   Boring. Predictable. Arsenal did just enough. Roma needs a complete overhaul.

<strong>Dynamo Kyiv 🇺🇦 2-3 Valencia 🇪🇸:</strong>

•   Valencia clinching it in the second leg. Dynamo Kyiv showed some fight in the first leg but were exposed as a weak team.</div>
