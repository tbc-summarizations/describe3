  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rundown of those Champions League qualifying results, no holds barred:

<strong>Champions Path:</strong>

•   <strong>RFS 🇱🇻 1-5 Malmö 🇸🇪:</strong> RFS, you got absolutely dismantled. 5 goals is embarrassing. Enjoy Europa League qualifying, you won't be missed. Malmö, a professional job. Keep it up and you might actually make a group stage.

•   <strong>Hamrun Spartans 🇲🇹 0-6 Dynamo Kyiv 🇺🇦:</strong> Hamrun, you’re an utter disgrace. 6-0? Might as well pack your bags and go home. Kyiv, showed no mercy, as they should. Keep this form going.

•   <strong>Pafos 🇨🇾 2-1 Maccabi Tel Aviv 🇮🇱:</strong> Pafos, a narrow victory, but a victory nonetheless. Good on you for sneaking through. Maccabi, disappointing. Expected better. Time to reflect on what went wrong, which is clearly a lot.

•   <strong>Lincoln Red Imps 🇬🇮 1-6 Red Star Belgrade 🇷🇸:</strong> Lincoln, you were fodder. 6-1? An embarrassment to Gibraltar. Belgrade, clinical. Next round is a real test.

•   <strong>Noah 🇦🇲 4-6 Ferencvaros 🇭🇺:</strong> Noah, you put up a fight, but ultimately not enough. A respectable exit, I guess. Ferencvaros, decent job, nothing spectacular. Need to tighten up the defense if you want to go further.

•   <strong>Lech Poznan 🇵🇱 8-1 Breiðablik 🇮🇸:</strong> Lech Poznan, that's the kind of result you want to see. Utter dominance. Breiðablik, you were a joke. 8-1? Stay in Iceland where you belong.

•   <strong>Copenhagen 🇩🇰 3-0 Drita 🇽🇰:</strong> Copenhagen, solid, professional. Get the job done. Drita, expected nothing less than mediocrity.

•   <strong>Rijeka 🇭🇷 1-3 Ludogorets 🇧🇬:</strong> Rijeka, disappointing, especially at home. Ludogorets, a well-deserved win. Keep grinding and you may get some upsets.

•   <strong>Shkëndija 🇲🇰 3-1 FCSB 🇷🇴:</strong> Shkëndija, an unexpected victory, kudos to you. FCSB, pathetic. What happened to Romanian football? Get it together.

•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava 🇸🇰 6-2 Zrinjski Mostar 🇧🇦:</strong> Slovan, you trounced them. Bratislava for the win. Zrinjski, you were a laughingstock. Back to Bosnia with your tail between your legs.

•   <strong>Shelbourne 🇮🇪 0-4 Qarabağ 🇦🇿:</strong> Shelbourne, another embarrassing defeat. You're not cut out for this level. Qarabağ, ruthless. Send a message to the rest of the competition.

•   <strong>KuPS 🇫🇮 2-3 Kairat 🇰🇿:</strong> KuPS, close but no cigar. Decent effort, but not enough. Kairat, a hard-fought victory. Keep the momentum going.

<strong>League Path:</strong>

•   <strong>Brann 🇳🇴 2-5 Red Bull Salzburg 🇦🇹:</strong> Brann, outclassed. Salzburg, another step closer to the riches of the Champions League.

•   <strong>Viktoria Plzeň 🇨🇿 3-2 Servette 🇨🇭:</strong> Plzeň, scraped by. Servette, a valiant effort, but ultimately not enough.

•   <strong>Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 3-1 Panathinaikos 🇬🇷:</strong> Rangers, a solid win in front of the Ibrox faithful. Panathinaikos, go back to Greece and sort your mess out.</div>
