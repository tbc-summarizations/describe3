  <div class="discord-text">Alright, baby, let's give these Pharaoh Sanders albums a Bublé-esque rating! You know I've got my own set of pipes, but this cat can blow! I will give you brutally honest ratings on them.

•   <strong>Pharaoh:</strong> 6/10 - It's a solid start, but it's missing that certain something to make it truly stand out in the crowded world of jazz.

•   <strong>Tauhid:</strong> 8/10 - Now we're talking! You can tell this album has something to say! This has some chops and some heart - just the way I like it.

•   <strong>Karma:</strong> 9/10 - Smooth like butter, this is a masterpiece. I gotta say, it's almost perfect, and I could definitely croon along.

•   <strong>Jewels of Thought:</strong> 7/10 - I hear the innovation, man. It's like taking a walk into the avant-garde - interesting, but not always my cup of tea.

•   <strong>Deaf Dumb Blind (Summun bukmun umyun):</strong> 6/10 - Bit of a mixed bag here, gotta say. It's got its moments, but it doesn't all hang together for me.

•   <strong>Thembi:</strong> 5/10 - Yeah, I don't really like this one. 

•   <strong>Black Unity:</strong> 7/10 - Some real passion here, you can feel it. It's got that soulful vibe that gets ya right in the gut.

•   <strong>Izipho zam (My Gifts):</strong> 5/10 - I'm not feeling this one.

•   <strong>Wisdom Through Music:</strong> 5/10 - I'm really not feeling it.

•   <strong>Village of the Pharoahs:</strong> 6/10 - Some cool sounds on this one.

•   <strong>Love in Us All:</strong> 5/10 - Nah.

•   <strong>Pharoah:</strong> 6/10 - This one is average.

•   <strong>Love Will Find a Way:</strong> 5/10 - No.

•   <strong>Journey to the One:</strong> 5/10 - Not it.

•   <strong>Rejoice:</strong> 6/10 - Average at best.

•   <strong>Shukuru:</strong> 5/10 - I'm not feeling it.

•   <strong>Oh Lord, Let Me Do No Wrong:</strong> 6/10 - I'm not into it

•   <strong>Africa:</strong> 7/10 - Now this is much better

•   <strong>A Prayer Before Dawn:</strong> 5/10 - Nothing special.

•   <strong>Moon Child:</strong> 6/10 - It's nothing to write home about.

•   <strong>Welcome To Love:</strong> 6/10 - I don't love it.

•   <strong>Ballads With Love:</strong> 5/10 - Nothing special

•   <strong>Crescent with Love:</strong> 5/10 - Nope.

•   <strong>Solomon's Daughter:</strong> 5/10 - Forgettable.

•   <strong>Message From Home:</strong> 5/10 - Nah.

•   <strong>Save Our Children:</strong> 5/10 - Not for me.

•   <strong>Spirits:</strong> 7/10 - Good Album!

•   <strong>With a Heartbeat:</strong> 5/10 - A bit too soft for me.

•   <strong>The Creator Has a Master Plan:</strong> 1/10 - Awful Song.

•   <strong>Spiral Mercury:</strong> 5/10 - Forgettable.

•   <strong>Primative Jupiter:</strong> 6/10 - It's nothing special.
