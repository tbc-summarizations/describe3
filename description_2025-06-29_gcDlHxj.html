  <div class="discord-text">The image is a screenshot of a Roblox home screen, showcasing a user's profile ("Berishbaev"), friends list, recently played games, and various game recommendations. The interface includes typical Roblox elements like the navigation menu, search bar, currency icons, and game thumbnails. The friends list features avatars with usernames, and the "Your Most Played" section highlights games like "Grow a Garden," "Transport," "Murder Mystery 2," and "Tower of Hell." Below, there's a "Continue" section with car games and a Kazakhstan-themed game, as well as a "Favorites" section. The overall layout is colorful and game-centric, designed to encourage user engagement and exploration within the Roblox platform. There is a roblox username called "NIGGAS" in the friend's list.</div>
