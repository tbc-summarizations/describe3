  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest attempt at building a competitive XI from those nations. Let's be real, this is going to be a challenge, but I'll focus on players who are actually playing at a decent level right now, and where possible, build a functional system.

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3 (because anything else would be a crime given the limitations)</strong>

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Marko Meerits (Estonia):</strong> Honestly, the pickings are slim. Meerits has been around for a while and seems to be the most consistent choice available from these nations. Don't expect miracles.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Back: Thomas Meunier (Belgium):</strong> Okay, finally a solid pick. Meunier at his best is a very capable attacking fullback. He's decent defensively.
•   <strong>Center Back: Wout Faes (Belgium):</strong> Faes is playing regularly in the Premier League which makes him an automatic pick. He's not the most graceful, but he's physical and gives it his all.
•   <strong>Center Back: Andreas Granqvist (Sweden):</strong> Alright, here's where we get creative. Granqvist is getting up there in age, but this team is desperate for leadership and experience. We're banking on his veteran presence to hold things together.
•   <strong>Left Back: Ludwig Augustinsson (Sweden):</strong> A solid player with some European experience, Augustine is an easy choice at Left-Back, decent defensively and technically better than anyone else in the list available.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Midfield: Anel Sabanadzovic (Azerbaijan):</strong> Here's a punt. A young player getting some exposure in the Croatian First Division. He is someone who can tackle, pass a ball a few yards, and make simple decisions to keep the ball moving. I'm not expecting him to boss midfield, but at least be functional.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Marcel Sabitzer (Austria):</strong> One of the few genuine stars in this lineup. Sabitzer's work rate and technical ability make him the engine of the team. Needs to be given license to roam and create.
•   <strong>Central Midfield: Albin Ekdal (Sweden):</strong> Here's a player who can offer some solidity, experience, and steel in the midfield. He can also pass a ball.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Wing: Dejan Kulusevski (Sweden):</strong> Our other star. Kulusevski needs to be the main attacking outlet. Give him the ball and let him create.
•   <strong>Center Forward: Zlatan Ibrahimović (Sweden):</strong> At age 42 it's obviously tough to say when he will be back on the pitch but we can only hope to god that he finds some form and gets back in the lineup.
•   <strong>Left Wing: Johan Bakayoko (Belgium):</strong> One of the better young and promising talents available with a good skillset and technique in his left foot. This is somebody who is getting better and with experience with all these players will make a deadly force for the team.

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Sabitzer and Kulusevski provide the only real attacking threat. Experience in defense could be useful.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The midfield is desperately lacking in creativity and quality. The defense will be constantly under pressure. The attack is entirely reliant on two players.

This team would struggle against any decent international side. The best hope is to play defensively, try to keep the score down, and hope that Kulusevski or Ibrahimović can produce a moment of magic.</div>
