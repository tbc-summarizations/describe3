  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these groups with some brutally honest predictions:

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Germany:</strong> They should top this group based on sheer pedigree and the ability to grind out results, even when not playing at their best. Expect efficient, if not always thrilling, football.
•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> They'll likely grab the second spot. They have the talent to be dangerous, but consistency is their issue. They'll struggle against Germany but should secure wins against Wales and Ukraine.
•   <strong>Wales:</strong> They'll be a tough, physical team to play against, but ultimately lack the quality to progress. Expect them to battle hard for draws but fall short.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> They're the weakest team in the group. They lack the firepower and experience to compete with the established European powerhouses.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>England:</strong> They should dominate this group with their star-studded squad. Expect confident, attacking football and comfortable wins against Sweden and Belgium.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> They'll secure second place, but their ageing squad lacks the quality of their golden era. They will lose to England.
•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> Their 'golden generation' is fading fast, and they lack the defensive stability to compete. They will struggle and exit early.
•   <strong>Sweden:</strong> Decent but not great. They'll put up a fight, but their lack of individual brilliance will see them finish at the bottom.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> Their talent pool is unrivalled, and they should comfortably top this group. Expect dazzling attacking displays.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> They'll finish second but rely heavily on individual brilliance rather than team cohesion.
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> This is a group of death for them. They will put up a fight but will likely fail to qualify.
•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> They will try to play a defensive game but will likely lack the firepower.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>Italy:</strong> Based on recent form, Italy will top this group. Their solid defence will ensure victories.
•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> Their ageing midfield won't be enough to take the top spot.
•   <strong>Denmark:</strong> They have a decent team but will struggle against Italy.
•   <strong>Austria:</strong> They are probably the weakest in this group and will most likely finish last.</div>
