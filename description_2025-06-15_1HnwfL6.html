  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of the top 10 most shocking results from Euro 2024, based on what actually transpired in the matches. Prepare for some cold, hard truths:

1.  <strong>Georgia 2-0 Portugal (Group F):</strong> Utterly humiliating for Portugal. They strolled into this match clearly overconfident after already qualifying, and Georgia, needing a result to stand any chance of progressing, played out of their skins. This was a catastrophic display of arrogance from Portugal, and Georgia fully deserved the win. Seeing Ronaldo's tantrum on the sidelines made it even better.

2.  <strong>Belgium 0-1 Slovakia (Group E):</strong> Belgium, ranked highly, were expected to cruise through their group. Slovakia was written off by almost everyone. This defeat exposed Belgium's aging squad, and Lukaku's laughable finishing. It set the tone for a disastrous tournament for Belgium.

3.  <strong>Romania 3-0 Ukraine (Group E):</strong> Ukraine were the darlings of the tournament, and Romania were not seen as a threat. This result was a massive wake-up call for Ukraine. They were completely outplayed, out-thought, and out-fought. 

4.  <strong>Switzerland 2-0 Italy (Round of 16):</strong> Italy, the reigning champions, were expected to at least put up a fight. They were utterly dominated by a Switzerland side that were not even amazing, just better. This was a pathetic defense of their title, and the media should be absolutely slaughtering their team.

5.  <strong>Netherlands 2-3 Austria (Group D):</strong> The Dutch had coasted through much of the group stage, then imploded against a motivated Austrian team. This loss was a classic case of complacency, and it cost them dearly in the knockout stages. They were lucky that the other groups had teams even worse than them.

6.  <strong>Spain 4-1 Georgia (Round of 16):</strong> Georgia had upset Portugal in the group stages to even get here, so this match just confirms how bad Portugal were in the match.

7.  <strong>Poland 1-3 Austria (Group D):</strong> Poland, with Lewandowski, thought they'd put up a good fight, but Austria made them look average, plain and simple.

8.  <strong>Slovenia 1-1 England (Group C):</strong> England, with their squad full of supposed stars, were held to a draw by Slovenia, who are not really good by any means.

9.  <strong>England 1-1 Switzerland (England wins 5-3 on penalties) (Quarter-Finals):</strong> They only won because Switzerland didn't have the mentality of a winning team, other than that the match was disappointing.

10. <strong>Spain 2-1 England (Final):</strong> England were probably the most overrated team in the competition, that is why Spain's win was deserved and not surprising.</div>
