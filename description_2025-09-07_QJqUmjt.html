  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of the Armenia National Team based on the provided roster. Let's dive in:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Arsen Beglaryan (Alashkert):</strong> 4/10. Playing in the domestic league is a red flag. He's probably not a standout keeper, likely a decent shot-stopper at best but lacking international experience and likely prone to errors under pressure.
•   <strong>Henri Avagyan (Pyunik):</strong> 3/10. Similar to Beglaryan, likely not of the quality needed for international football. Expect shaky performances if called upon.
•   <strong>Ognjen Cancarevic (Noah):</strong> 5/10. Perhaps slightly better than the other two simply because he's probably more consistent. Still, he's not a game-changer.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Georgiy Harutyunyan (Puskás Akadémia):</strong> 6/10. Playing in Hungary is a slight step up, so he might possess some decent qualities. Likely an average defender, not particularly strong or fast.
•   <strong>Styopa Mkrtchyan (Osijek):</strong> 5/10. Croatia is a tougher league than Armenia, but not by a whole lot, so he's probably a decent, but unspectacular, player.
•   <strong>Sergey Muradyan (Noah):</strong> 3/10. Another domestic league player, indicating limited potential at the international level.
•   <strong>Erik Simonyan (Urartu):</strong> 3/10. Same concerns as Muradyan. Not likely to provide much stability or quality.
•   <strong>Erik Piloyan (Urartu):</strong> 3/10. Probably similar to Simonyan and Muradyan.
•   <strong>Albert Khachumyan (Ararat Yerevan):</strong> 3/10. Again, playing in the Armenian league doesn't inspire confidence. Expect him to be defensively suspect.
•   <strong>Nair Tiknizyan (Red Star Belgrade):</strong> 7/10. Playing for Red Star Belgrade is a positive sign. Probably the best defender in the squad, possessing decent pace, technique, and tactical awareness.
•   <strong>Edgar Grigoryan (Ararat-Armenia):</strong> 4/10. Likely a limited player who is defensively vulnerable.
•   <strong>Kamo Hovhannisyan (Ararat-Armenia):</strong> 4/10. Probably not a significant upgrade over other domestic-based defenders.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Ugochukwu Iwu (Rubin Kazan):</strong> 6/10. Playing in Russia suggests decent quality, but Russia is also an average league. Likely a physical player with limited technical ability.
•   <strong>Narek Aghasaryan (Urartu):</strong> 3/10. Likely a player who lacks the creativity and passing range needed to dictate play at the international level.
•   <strong>Daniel Aghbalyan (Pyunik):</strong> 3/10. Most likely not up to the standard for international football.
•   <strong>Hovhannes Harutyunyan (Noah):</strong> 3/10. Another domestic player, implying limited potential and likely struggles against higher-quality opposition.
•   <strong>Artak Dashyan (Noah):</strong> 3/10. Expect slow play, limited passing options, and defensive naivety.
•   <strong>Eduard Spertsyan (Krasnodar):</strong> 8/10. One of the few bright spots. Playing for Krasnodar shows promise. He's probably technically gifted, with good vision and passing ability. A key player for the team.
•   <strong>Lucas Zelarayan (Atletico Belgrano):</strong> 7/10. Likely an experienced player with good technical skills.
•   <strong>Gor Manvelyan (Noah):</strong> 3/10. Not likely to make a difference.
•   <strong>Karen Nalbandyan (Alashkert):</strong> 3/10. Similar to the other domestic-based midfielders, probably lacks the quality needed to compete at a higher level.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Zhirayr Shaghoyan (Ararat-Armenia):</strong> 4/10. Likely a striker who lacks the pace and clinical finishing needed to score goals consistently.
•   <strong>Edgar Sevikyan (Ferencváros):</strong> 6/10. His experience in the Hungarian league is a plus point.
•   <strong>Tigran Barseghyan (Slovan Bratislava):</strong> 6/10. Probably an average winger, but not exceptional.
•   <strong>Vahan Bichakhchyan (Legia Warsaw):</strong> 6/10. Probably lacks the consistency and killer instinct needed to excel at the international level.
•   <strong>Artur Serobyan (Ararat-Armenia):</strong> 4/10. Limited potential at the international level.
•   <strong>Grant-Leon Ranos (Borussia Mönchengladbach):</strong> 7/10. Playing in Germany is a huge advantage. Potentially the most promising attacker in the squad, possessing pace, technique, and a good eye for goal.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 4/10</strong>

The squad is largely composed of players from the Armenian domestic league, which is a significant weakness. There are a few players in moderately stronger leagues, but only Spertsyan and Ranos seem to have genuine potential. The defense appears particularly weak, and the midfield lacks creativity outside of Spertsyan and Zelarayan. The attack relies heavily on Ranos to provide goals. Overall, this is a squad that is likely to struggle against stronger opposition. Expect them to be defensively vulnerable and lacking the firepower to consistently score goals.</div>
