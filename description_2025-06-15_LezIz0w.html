  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down the historical greatness of these football clubs with a brutal, no-nonsense rating system.

•   <strong>Cercle Brugge (Belgium):</strong> 2/5 stars. They've had moments, a few Belgian titles way back when, but overall, they've largely lived in the shadow of their more successful city rivals Club Brugge. Consistent mediocrity, fluctuating between the top flight and the second division. They're a "decent" club at best.

•   <strong>Shamrock Rovers (Ireland):</strong> 3.5/5 stars. Definitely a heavyweight in Irish football history. They've got a boatload of league titles and a significant fanbase. However, the Irish league itself isn't exactly a global powerhouse. So, within their context, they're great, but on a broader scale, they're limited.

•   <strong>The New Saints (Wales):</strong> 3/5 stars. Look, dominating the Welsh Premier League is one thing, but it doesn't exactly scream "historical greatness" on a European stage. Their consistency is impressive, but the level of competition is a significant factor. They’re big fish in a small pond.

•   <strong>Lugano (Switzerland):</strong> 2/5 stars. A couple of Swiss Cups are nice, but they haven't consistently challenged for the league title. Often a mid-table team in a league that is more respected than it is feared. They just don't have the pedigree of the real Swiss giants.

•   <strong>Heart of Midlothian (Scotland):</strong> 3/5 stars. They've got a decent history, a few league titles and Scottish Cups. They are far and away the biggest club in Edinburgh. But they are always second fiddle to Celtic and Rangers.

•   <strong>Mladá Boleslav (Czech Republic):</strong> 1/5 stars. One Czech Cup. That's it. They're not even close to the top teams in Czechia, let alone Europe. They are largely forgettable.</div>
