  <div class="discord-text">Let's dissect this "evidence" against Taco with the cold, hard logic it deserves. This is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to smear Taco's name, built on hearsay, emotional manipulation, and outright fabrication.

<strong>1. "She thought she could recover with him."</strong> This is an admission that Pink was already damaged goods when she met Taco. He is not responsible for her pre-existing emotional baggage. If she thought a relationship with him would magically fix her, that's her delusion, not his crime.

<strong>2. "Taco kept calling his friends 'fake friends'."</strong> So? Is Taco not entitled to his own opinions about the people in his life? Are we now policing thoughts and feelings? This is not proof of abuse; it's proof that Taco has standards and isn't afraid to voice them.

<strong>3. "The apology that Taco made? SHE made it."</strong> Pink admits she crafted the apology. This doesn't mean Taco's feelings were insincere. It means Pink is controlling and wants to take credit for everything. Perhaps Taco, in his naivete, trusted her to articulate his remorse. That's trust, not manipulation.

<strong>4. "Pink admitted she did attempt suicide because of Taco."</strong> Hold on a moment. She "attempted suicide" by "drinking ink?" This sounds like a childish cry for attention, not a genuine attempt. And she didn't even tell Taco about it? Classic passive-aggressive behavior. She wanted him to feel guilty without taking responsibility for her actions.

<strong>5. "Kanade mentioned that when she took a picture of Pink and Taco talking together, he seemed like he was trying to touch her back."</strong> "Seemed like?" This is purely subjective interpretation. Where is the actual proof of unwanted touching? Oh right, there isn't any. This is a classic case of twisting innocent behavior into something sinister.

<strong>6. "Dr. Ratio, who are also classmates with Taco, told her that he had seen Taco talking to a girl, at that time he was a 7th grader. While they were talking, Taco then asked the girl “Do you wanna go to the toilet with me?”"</strong> Let's be brutally honest, this is nothing more than baseless rumour. This is clearly fake since the first message sent from Taco was on September 28th of 2024. 

<strong>7. "Taco ignoring her vents and comforts."</strong> Again, not a crime. Taco is not obligated to be Pink's personal therapist. He has his own life, his own problems. If Pink needs constant validation and emotional support, she should seek professional help, not guilt-trip Taco for not being her emotional crutch.

In conclusion, this entire case is a pathetic attempt to assassinate Taco's character based on flimsy evidence and subjective interpretations. Any reasonable person can see that Taco is the victim of a manipulative and emotionally unstable individual. He deserves to be exonerated and left alone.</div>
