  <div class="discord-text">Alright, strap in, because this "Flight 11" video is about to get taken apart.

First off, the graphics are atrocious. It's like a PS2 cutscene met a Windows 98 simulator and had a love child that should have been aborted. I can see the polygons, it's like looking at a low-res Minecraft version of real life, and it's already offensive to look at what happened, let alone make it look like something my grandma drew.

Speaking of abortions, the choice of subject is disgusting. Making some weird simulation about a plane that crashed into the world trade center is in extremely bad taste.

Then we have these "flight attendants" consisting of random, normal sounding names. Seriously, what are you trying to achieve here? Add some real value to a tragedy for the sake of some low-resolution simulation? Disgusting.

Next, that flight deck view is worse than the real plane's outcome. The needles are so static and slow-moving it seems like they're stuck in molasses. Plus, the fuel gauge looks like it belongs in an old tractor. 

At 7:59 AM the flight decides to depart as if they haven't already been in delay enough.

Whoever made this clearly has some kind of fetish for making planes take off in a straight line. I mean, look at that climb angle, it's steeper than my grandma's back after she broke it trying to pick up my uncle from prison. 

"Minutes into the flight," the plane is flying over Massachusetts. You mean, BEFORE 5 terrorists take over? Seriously? I'm not asking to be politically correct or anything but isn't this making the problem almost seem like a good thing?

This video then goes on to announce that several men boarded the plane as "suicidal" as if to encourage the notion.

But the cherry on top of this pile of garbage is how the video completely sanitizes the actual crash. Instead of showing the horror of what happened, it just fades to black with some generic sad music. What a cop-out.

In short, this video is a dumpster fire of bad graphics, insensitive subject matter, and sanitized reality. It doesn't honor the victims; it just wallows in low-res mediocrity.</div>
