  <h1>Description for 250px-Flag_of_Belgium.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of those Belgian clubs, ranked out of 10 based on their overall significance, history, and current standing within Belgian football:

•   <strong>Anderlecht:</strong> 9/10. This is the top dog. Historically the most dominant club in Belgium, a ton of titles, consistent European presence, and a massive fanbase. They might have dips in form, but their overall impact and legacy are undeniable.

•   <strong>Beerschot:</strong> 3/10. A smaller club from Antwerp, plagued by financial issues and inconsistency. They have some history, but they're not a major force. They've been in and out of the top league too much.

•   <strong>Cercle Brugge:</strong> 4/10. Always in the shadow of their bigger brothers. Not a particularly strong team.

•   <strong>Club Brugge:</strong> 8.5/10. Always trying to compete with Anderlecht and consistently good.

•   <strong>Dender:</strong> 2/10. A smaller team, has never been relevant.

•   <strong>KAA Gent:</strong> 7.5/10. Good history, has recently been very good.

•   <strong>KRC Genk:</strong> 7.5/10. Solid club with a good track record of developing talent and has won the league a few times.

•   <strong>KV Kortrijk:</strong> 3/10. Smaller club that is inconsistent.

•   <strong>KV Mechelen:</strong> 6/10. Used to be the best team in Belgium but has declined.

•   <strong>Oud-Heverlee Leuven:</strong> 4/10. Only been in the top flight for 20 years.

•   <strong>Royal Antwerp:</strong> 7/10. Oldest club in the country, great fan base.

•   <strong>Sporting Charleroi:</strong> 5/10. Not that big of a club.

•   <strong>Standard Liege:</strong> 7/10. One of the biggest clubs in the country.

•   <strong>STVV:</strong> 4/10. Nothing special.

•   <strong>Union Saint-Gilloise:</strong> 7/10. A club that is rapidly rising and has been really good recently.

•   <strong>Westerlo:</strong> 3/10. Always a team that is around and has some decent play.</div>
