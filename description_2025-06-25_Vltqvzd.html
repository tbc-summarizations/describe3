  <h1>Description for green.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of these clubs from worst to best, based on a mix of current form, historical significance, and overall quality. I'm not pulling any punches here:

<strong>Absolutely Atrocious Tier</strong>

1.  <strong>Zimbru Chisinau 🇲🇩:</strong> Let's be real, they're a nobody in a nothing league. 
2.  <strong>Atyrau 🇰🇿:</strong> Playing in Kazakhstan doesn't exactly scream "footballing powerhouse."
3.  <strong>Egnatia 🇦🇱:</strong> Albanian football is still developing, and they're not exactly setting the world on fire.
4.  <strong>The New Saints 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Dominate a weak league, but are hopeless in Europe.
5.  <strong>Zilina 🇸🇰:</strong> A team from a tiny country that I have 0 respect for.
6.  <strong>Breidablik 🇮🇸:</strong> Icelandic football is just not there yet
7.  <strong>Karpaty Lviv 🇺🇦:</strong> Barely staying afloat
8.  <strong>Flora Tallinn 🇪🇪:</strong> I feel bad for all of Estonia
9.  <strong>Shamrock Rovers 🇮🇪:</strong> Irish football is still at a amateurish level
10. <strong>Auda 🇱🇻:</strong> From Latvia, enough said

<strong>Mediocre and Forgettable Tier</strong>

11. <strong>Jablonec 🇨🇿:</strong> Never gonna be relevant
12. <strong>Olimpija Ljubljana 🇸🇮:</strong> Slovenia is a weak country.
13. <strong>Viborg 🇩🇰:</strong> Forgettable team, Denmark has so much better
14. <strong>Groningen 🇳🇱:</strong> They've had their moments, but are inconsistent and uninspiring lately.
15. <strong>Zalgiris 🇱🇹:</strong> Can't even remember them on the pitch ever
16. <strong>Omonia Nicosia 🇨🇾:</strong> The only thing they have going on is the name.

<strong>Decent but Not Great Tier</strong>

17. <strong>Ludogorets 🇧🇬:</strong> They dominate Bulgaria, but flop in Europe, rendering them insignificant.
18. <strong>Cercle Brugge 🇧🇪:</strong> A feeder club for Monaco, existing solely to develop talent for someone else.
19. <strong>Plymouth 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> A nobody team.

<strong>Actually Competent Tier</strong>

20. <strong>St. Gallen 🇨🇭:</strong> Swiss football can be surprisingly good, but they're not top-tier.
21. <strong>Bursaspor 🇹🇷:</strong> A fallen giant of Turkish football, trying to claw their way back to relevance.
22.  <strong>Legia Warsaw 🇵🇱:</strong> They can be decent, but generally lack quality.

<strong>Respectable and Sometimes Exciting Tier</strong>

23. <strong>Rapid Wien 🇦🇹:</strong> A solid Austrian team with a good history, but inconsistent performances.
24. <strong>Hammarby 🇸🇪:</strong> Swedish football is pretty good
25. <strong>Krasnodar 🇷🇺:</strong> Solid Russian side

<strong>The Actually Good Teams</strong>

26. <strong>Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> Dominate Scotland but struggle in Europe, which limits their overall prestige.
27. <strong>Sporting CP 🇵🇹:</strong> One of Portugal's "big three," but often overshadowed by Porto and Benfica.
28. <strong>Panathinaikos 🇬🇷:</strong> A great team, Greece is also great.
29. <strong>Saint-Etienne 🇫🇷:</strong> A sleeping giant with a great history, trying to rebuild its former glory.
30. <strong>Sassuolo 🇮🇹:</strong> Consistently a mid-table Serie A team.
31. <strong>Ferencvaros 🇭🇺:</strong> Dominate Hungary, but has their moments in Europe.

<strong>Top Tier</strong>

32. <strong>Werder Bremen 🇩🇪:</strong> Historically a powerhouse, currently on the rise again, can be exciting to watch.
33. <strong>Real Betis 🇪🇸:</strong> Capable of playing great football, but not consistent enough to truly challenge for major honors.</div>
