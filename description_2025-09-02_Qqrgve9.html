  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into these lineups and tear them apart, brutally honest as you requested. We're talking about winning the Champions League, so the stakes are high.

<strong>Premier League 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper (David Raya):</strong> 6/10. He's decent, but not a world-beater. Makes some silly mistakes at times and is prone to errors when facing under pressure.
•   <strong>Defenders (Gvardiol, Gabriel, Saliba, Timber):</strong> 8/10. Solid across the board. Gvardiol is quality, Gabriel and Saliba are a strong partnership, and Timber adds versatility.
•   <strong>Defensive Midfielders (Rodri, Rice):</strong> 9/10. Arguably the best DM pairing here. Rodri is world-class, and Rice complements him perfectly.
•   <strong>Attacking Midfielders (Gakpo, Wirtz, Saka):</strong> 8/10. Good creativity and flair. Wirtz is the real star, and Saka is always dangerous. Gakpo is kinda mid.
•   <strong>Attacker (Haaland):</strong> 10/10. An absolute goal machine. If he's fit, he's a threat to any defense.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 8.2/10.</strong> This team is strong defensively and has a lethal striker, but I have some doubts about that attacking midfielders and goalkeeper.

<strong>Serie A 🇮🇹</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper (Maignan):</strong> 8/10. A top-level keeper, but can be prone to injuries.
•   <strong>Defenders (Dimarco, Bastoni, Buongiorno, Dumfries):</strong> 7/10. Decent, but not spectacular. Bastoni is the standout here.
•   <strong>Defensive Midfielders (McTominay, Barella):</strong> 6/10. Barella is good, but McTominay? He's not Champions League quality, sorry Scottish fans.
•   <strong>Attacking Midfielders (Leão, Lookman, Pulisic):</strong> 7/10. Leão is the only real threat, the other two are only good on their day.
•   <strong>Attacker (Lautaro Martinez):</strong> 8/10. A very good striker, but not on the same level as Haaland or Mbappe.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6.8/10.</strong> This team lacks the overall quality to compete with the others. The midfield is a major weakness.

<strong>La Liga 🇪🇸</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper (Unai Simon):</strong> 7/10. Solid, reliable, but nothing special.
•   <strong>Defenders (Balde, Huijsen, Cubarsi, Alexander-Arnold):</strong> 8/10. Alexander-Arnold has not been good lately, but the young Spanish defenders are quality.
•   <strong>Defensive Midfielders (Pedri, Valverde):</strong> 9/10. An excellent pairing. Both are box-to-box dynamos.
•   <strong>Attacking Midfielders (Vinicius Junior, Bellingham, Yamal):</strong> 10/10. This is where this team shines. Pure attacking talent.
•   <strong>Attacker (Mbappe):</strong> 10/10. One of the best in the world. Electric pace and clinical finishing.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 8.8/10.</strong> This team has a fantastic attack and a solid midfield. Defense and goalkeeper are just the average.

<strong>Bundesliga 🇩🇪</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper (Kobel):</strong> 8/10. A very good goalkeeper.
•   <strong>Defenders (Davies, Upamecano, Kim, Stanisic):</strong> 7/10. Davies and Kim are the standouts.
•   <strong>Defensive Midfielders (Kimmich, Pavlovic):</strong> 8/10. Kimmich is world-class, but Pavlovic is still unproven at the highest level.
•   <strong>Attacking Midfielders (Diaz, Musiala, Olise):</strong> 8/10. Musiala is the star here, and Diaz and Olise are good additions.
•   <strong>Attacker (Kane):</strong> 10/10. A proven goalscorer and a leader.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7.8/10.</strong> This team is solid, but not quite at the level of the Premier League or La Liga teams. The defense is a bit shaky.

<strong>Ligue 1 🇫🇷</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper (Donnarumma):</strong> 7/10. He has potential, but he's prone to errors and seems to lack confidence lately.
•   <strong>Defenders (Mendes, Pacho, Zabarnyi, Hakimi):</strong> 7/10. Hakimi is the best of the bunch, but the others are not top-tier.
•   <strong>Defensive Midfielders (Vitinha, Neves):</strong> 7/10. Promising, but inexperienced.
•   <strong>Attacking Midfielders (Kvaratskhelia, Enciso, Doue):</strong> 7/10. Talented, but inconsistent.
•   <strong>Attacker (Ramos):</strong> 6/10. Not good enough to lead the line for a Champions League-winning team.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7.0/10.</strong> This team has potential, but lacks the experience and quality to win the Champions League.

<strong>The Verdict:</strong>

The <strong>La Liga</strong> team is the most likely to win the Champions League. The attacking trio of Vinicius Junior, Bellingham, and Mbappe is unstoppable, and the midfield is strong. The Premier League team is a close second, but the La Liga team has the edge in attacking firepower.</div>
