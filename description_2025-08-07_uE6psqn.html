  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's brutally assess these Ballon d'Or nominees:

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 9/10. Potential world-beater, already bossing midfield.
•   <strong>Ousmane Dembele 🇫🇷:</strong> 6/10. Incredibly inconsistent. Flashes of brilliance, but too injury-prone and unreliable.
•   <strong>Gianluigi Donnarumma 🇮🇹:</strong> 7/10. Good shot-stopper, but can be error-prone for a top keeper.
•   <strong>Desire Doue 🇫🇷:</strong> 6/10. Exciting talent but needs more consistency.
•   <strong>Denzel Dumfries 🇳🇱:</strong> 6/10. Solid wing-back, but nothing spectacular.
•   <strong>Serhou Guirassy 🇬🇳:</strong> 6/10. Good goalscorer but needs to prove himself outside of Bundesliga
•   <strong>Viktor Gyökeres 🇸🇪:</strong> 7/10. Hard-working forward, good link up play, can score goals too.
•   <strong>Erling Haaland 🇳🇴:</strong> 9/10. A goal machine, needs to add more dimensions to his game to be a perfect 10.
•   <strong>Achraf Hakimi 🇲🇦:</strong> 7/10. Great going forward.
•   <strong>Harry Kane 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 9/10. Consistent goalscorer.
•   <strong>HenryThe Kazakh 🇰🇿:</strong> 1/10. Obviously, he isn't on the list
•   <strong>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia 🇬🇪:</strong> 7/10. Electric winger, needs to maintain consistency
•   <strong>Robert Lewandowski 🇵🇱:</strong> 8/10. Still a clinical finisher but his age is catching up.
•   <strong>Alexis Mac Allister 🇦🇷:</strong> 7/10. Reliable midfielder, good technique.
•   <strong>Lautaro Martinez 🇦🇷:</strong> 8/10. Deadly in the box, great work rate.
•   <strong>Kylian Mbappe 🇫🇷:</strong> 10/10. The closest thing to football perfection right now. Pace, skill, finishing, everything.
•   <strong>Scott McTominay 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 4/10. Decent squad player, but nowhere near Ballon d'Or level.
•   <strong>Nuno Mendes 🇵🇹:</strong> 6/10. Promising, but needs to stay fit and develop further.
•   <strong>Joao Neves 🇵🇹:</strong> 6/10. Talented youngster, still raw.
•   <strong>Michael Olise 🇫🇷:</strong> 7/10. Skillful and creative.
•   <strong>Cole Palmer 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 7/10. Promising talent, good decision-making in the final third.
•   <strong>Pedri 🇪🇸:</strong> 7/10. Fantastic vision and technique, needs to stay fit.
•   <strong>Raphinha 🇧🇷:</strong> 6/10. A bit inconsistent.
•   <strong>Declan Rice 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 8/10. Top defensive midfielder, great engine and leadership.
•   <strong>Fabian Ruiz 🇪🇸:</strong> 6/10. Decent midfielder, but lacks a standout quality.
•   <strong>Mohamed Salah 🇪🇬:</strong> 8/10. Still a dangerous winger, but slightly past his peak.
•   <strong>Virgil van Dijk 🇳🇱:</strong> 8/10. Dominant defender, but has lost a yard of pace.
•   <strong>Vinicius Jr. 🇧🇷:</strong> 9/10. Electric winger, scoring more goals now.
•   <strong>Vitinha 🇵🇹:</strong> 6/10. Decent midfielder, good passing range.
•   <strong>Florian Wirtz 🇩🇪:</strong> 8/10. Creative playmaker, great vision.
•   <strong>Lamine Yamal 🇪🇸:</strong> 7/10. Huge potential, still very young.</div>
