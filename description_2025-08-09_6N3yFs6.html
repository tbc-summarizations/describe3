  <h1>Description for 281.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this Manchester City squad apart piece by piece with my brutally honest assessment. I'm not holding back.

<strong>Manager:</strong>

•   <strong>Pep Guardiola (🇪🇸):</strong> 10/10. This is a no-brainer. If he's still there, he's still one of the best managers in the world. No debate.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>James Trafford (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Could be a decent keeper, but he's not world-class material, and likely will never be. He's alright.
•   <strong>Ederson (🇧🇷):</strong> 7/10. Still good, but nearing the end of his peak. His distribution remains top-tier, but shot-stopping has become a concern.
•   <strong>Stefan Ortega (🇩🇪):</strong> 6/10. A capable backup, nothing more. Won't win you any titles.
•   <strong>Marcus Bettinelli (🇮🇹):</strong> 3/10. A waste of space. Probably just there to fill a homegrown quota.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Ruben Dias (🇵🇹):</strong> 9/10. Still a rock at the back. One of the best center-backs in the world if he maintains form.
•   <strong>Abdukodir Khusanov (🇺🇿):</strong> 5/10. He might be good but playing for Uzbeksitan isn't going to win any points.
•   <strong>Manuel Akanji (🇨🇭):</strong> 7/10. Solid and versatile. A reliable option, but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>John Stones (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Past his prime and injury-prone. A squad player at best.
•   <strong>Nathan Ake (🇳🇱):</strong> 7/10. Underrated. Dependable and consistent, but lacks that top-level quality.
•   <strong>Josko Gvardiol (🇭🇷):</strong> 8/10. A top prospect. Has the potential to be world-class, but needs to develop further.
•   <strong>Rayan Ait-Nouri (🇩🇿):</strong> 6/10. Average full-back. Decent going forward, but defensively suspect.
•   <strong>Nico O'Reilly (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 4/10. Probably a academy player. Not good enough for city.
•   <strong>Josh Wilson-Esbran (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10. Average to say the least.
•   <strong>Rico Lewis (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Promising young player. Versatile and energetic, but needs more experience.
•   <strong>Issa Kaboré (🇧🇫):</strong> 5/10. Another average player.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Rodri (🇪🇸):</strong> 9/10. World-class defensive midfielder. The anchor of the team. Indispensable.
•   <strong>Kalvin Phillips (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10. A flop. Never lived up to expectations. Will be sold soon.
•   <strong>Tijjani Reijnders (🇳🇱):</strong> 7/10. He could be something if he is coached right.
•   <strong>Nico Gonzalez (🇪🇸):</strong> 6/10. Average. Nothing else to say.
•   <strong>Matheus Nunes (🇵🇹):</strong> 7/10. Decent midfielder.
•   <strong>Mateo Kovacic (🇭🇷):</strong> 7/10. Still a good player at his age.
•   <strong>Sverre Nypan (🇳🇴):</strong> 6/10. Could be an interesting player but it would be too early to tell.
•   <strong>Ilkay Gundogan (🇩🇪):</strong> 8/10. Still good but aging.
•   <strong>Bernardo Silva (🇵🇹):</strong> 8/10. World-class. Creative and hard-working. A key player.
•   <strong>James McAtee (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Might do well.
•   <strong>Claudio Echeverri (🇦🇷):</strong> 8/10. A very talented player.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Jeremy Doku (🇧🇪):</strong> 8/10. Exciting winger with pace and skill. Needs to improve his decision-making.
•   <strong>Jack Grealish (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Overrated. Good dribbler, but lacks end product.
•   <strong>Phil Foden (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 9/10. World-class potential. Versatile and creative. A future superstar.
•   <strong>Savinho (🇧🇷):</strong> 7/10. Could be good.
•   <strong>Rayan Cherki (🇫🇷):</strong> 8/10. Very talented.
•   <strong>Oscar Bobb (🇳🇴):</strong> 7/10. Could be great.
•   <strong>Erling Haaland (🇳🇴):</strong> 10/10. An absolute goal machine. A cheat code.
•   <strong>Omar Marmoush (🇪🇬):</strong> 5/10. Will be the biggest flop.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>7.5/10</strong>. This squad has a lot of talent, but it also has several weaknesses. The defense is aging, the midfield lacks depth, and the attack is too reliant on Haaland. Pep can always get the best out of any team but that doesn't mean that they are invinsible.</div>
