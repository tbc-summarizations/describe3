  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the roast of June 2020, served ice cold:

•   <strong>June 2 - Google's "Incognito" Mode Lawsuit (USA):</strong> Oh, Google, so you track us even when we think we're being sneaky? Guess that "incognito" mode is just a fancy lie, like saying you "don't do evil" anymore.
•   <strong>June 3 - UK's Hong Kong Citizenship Offer (UK):</strong> Boris Johnson, always one to jump on a PR opportunity. Offering citizenship like it's a clearance sale. Good luck figuring out how to actually house and help all those people you're promising a better life to.
•   <strong>June 3 - Putin's Oil Spill Disaster (Russia):</strong> Classic Putin, always finding new ways to poison his own country. "State of emergency" is just a fancy way of saying "I screwed up big time."
•   <strong>June 4 - Libya's Shifting Sands (Libya):</strong> Oh great, another power grab in Libya. You guys do you.
•   <strong>June 15 - Sino-Indian Border Clash (India, China):</strong> Ah yes, the age-old tradition of skirmishes in the Himalayas. At least 20 soldiers died.
•   <strong>June 15 - Turkey &amp; Iran vs. Kurdistan (Turkey, Iran):</strong> Because what the Middle East really needed was <em>more</em> conflict. Turkey and Iran casually dropping bombs, as if anyone is surprised.
•   <strong>June 16 - North Korea Blows Up Liaison Office (North Korea):</strong> Kim Jong-un, always the diplomat! Instead of talking, he blows stuff up. Such a mature way to improve relations. It's like North Korea is run by a spoiled toddler.
•   <strong>June 28 - COVID-19 Hits 10 Million (USA):</strong> 10 million confirmed cases worldwide? What a momentous occasion! And the USA, leading the pack with 2.5 million cases...yay? We're number one, we're number one, at dying from a preventable disease!
•   <strong>June 28 - COVID-19 Death Toll Exceeds 500,000 (UN):</strong> A milestone nobody wanted. Half a million dead. But hey, at least some people are still denying it's real.
•   <strong>June 30 - China's Hong Kong Security Law (China):</strong> Xi Jinping, flexing his muscles like it's going out of style. So much for "one country, two systems." More like "one country, your system is mine now."

Boom. Roasted.</div>
