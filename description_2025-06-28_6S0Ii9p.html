  <div class="discord-text">Alright, based on Maksim Samorodov's stats and profile, here's a brutally honest list of 10 European clubs that would be a realistic and suitable step up for him, considering his current level and potential:

1.  <strong>FC Twente (Netherlands - Eredivisie):</strong> A solid Dutch club known for developing young talent. The Eredivisie is a good stepping stone for players from less prominent leagues, and he would likely get playing time.

2.  <strong>FC Midtjylland (Denmark - Danish Superliga):</strong> They have a strong scouting network and are good at identifying undervalued talent. The Danish league is competitive but not overwhelming.

3.  <strong>Standard Liège (Belgium - Belgian Pro League):</strong> A club with a history of developing players and selling them on for a profit. The Belgian league is known for its physicality and transitional play.

4.  <strong>Vitesse Arnhem (Netherlands - Eredivisie):</strong> Historically linked with Chelsea, which could offer some potential visibility. They are a mid-table Eredivisie side where he could get regular minutes.

5.  <strong>Austria Wien (Austria - Austrian Bundesliga):</strong> A decent-sized club in a league that is often overlooked but can be a good starting point for players from Eastern Europe.

6.  <strong>Lech Poznań (Poland - Ekstraklasa):</strong> One of the bigger clubs in Poland, providing a platform in a league that is improving and gaining more attention.

7.  <strong>Hajduk Split (Croatia - Croatian First Football League):</strong> A historic club in a league that's a stepping stone to bigger leagues. Good for proving himself in a competitive environment.

8.  <strong>FK Crvena Zvezda (Serbia - Serbian SuperLiga):</strong> Dominant in their league, offering a chance for Champions League or Europa League qualification, although the overall quality of the league isn't high.

9.  <strong>Ludogorets Razgrad (Bulgaria - Bulgarian First League):</strong> A consistent presence in European competitions, giving him exposure on a continental level.

10. <strong>Hammarby IF (Sweden - Allsvenskan):</strong> Known for its strong fan base and decent league. It's a good place to build confidence and showcase his skills.

These clubs represent a mix of leagues where he could realistically get playing time and further develop his skills without being thrown into the deep end at a top-tier club right away. They also provide potential pathways to bigger clubs if he performs well.</div>
