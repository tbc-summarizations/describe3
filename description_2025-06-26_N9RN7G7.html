  <h1>Description for 250px-Flag_of_Ukraine.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my honest rating of those Ukrainian clubs, considering their history, current form, and overall impact:

•   <strong>Chornomorets Odesa: 4/10</strong>. They've got history, but they're just not the force they used to be. Often in the relegation conversation, they lack the investment to truly compete.

•   <strong>Dynamo Kyiv: 9/10</strong>. A historic powerhouse, and always a contender. However, they can be inconsistent on the European stage.

•   <strong>Inhulets Petrove: 3/10</strong>. A small club with limited resources. They struggle to attract top talent and are often fighting for survival.

•   <strong>Karpaty Lviv: 2/10</strong>. Sadly, they have sunk into the lower leagues. They can build up something again.

•   <strong>Kolos Kovalivka: 5/10</strong>. A solid mid-table team. They have a decent structure, but they don't have the quality to challenge the top clubs.

•   <strong>Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih: 6/10</strong>. A club with potential, but they need more time to establish themselves as a serious contender.

•   <strong>Livyi Bereh: 2/10</strong>. A newly formed team, they are yet to prove themselves as a professional team.

•   <strong>LNZ Cherkasy: 3/10</strong>. A newly promoted team. It remains to be seen if they can play in the elite.

•   <strong>Obolon Kyiv: 4/10</strong>. A team with potential, but they lack the resources to compete at the highest level.

•   <strong>Oleksandriya: 6/10</strong>. A consistently decent team. They are well-organized but lack the star power to make a real impact.

•   <strong>Polissya Zhytomyr: 5/10</strong>. An up-and-coming team. They're growing, but still a work in progress.

•   <strong>Rukh Lviv: 6/10</strong>. A promising team with a good youth system.

•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk: 9/10</strong>. The team is always at the top. However, they're inconsistent in Europe.

•   <strong>Veres Rivne: 4/10</strong>. A team that battles to stay in the league.

•   <strong>Vorskla Poltava: 6/10</strong>. Solid, but never quite good enough to break into the top tier consistently.

•   <strong>Zorya Luhansk: 7/10</strong>. Often a challenger for European spots. Decent team.</div>
