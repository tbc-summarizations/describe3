  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's the brutal truth about these teams and their chances in the 2025-26 UEFA Conference League:

<strong>The Actual Contenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Fiorentina 🇮🇹:</strong> 18%. They've been to the final recently, which shows they understand the competition. However, Serie A is tough, and their focus might be split. Still, they have the quality to make a deep run if they take it seriously.
•   <strong>AZ Alkmaar 🇳🇱:</strong> 12%. They consistently produce good young players and play attractive football. The Eredivisie isn't the most challenging league, so they can focus on Europe. But winning the whole thing? It's a big ask.
•   <strong>Crystal Palace 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 8%. The Premier League is so competitive, but if they build right and take the competition seriously, they've got a puncher's chance.
•   <strong>Mainz 05 🇩🇪:</strong> 7%. Consistently mid-table in the Bundesliga is a decent position but they lack the money to fully compete against other teams from other leagues, they would need a phenomenal season to win.

<strong>Teams With a Slight Chance (if everything goes right):</strong>

•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk 🇺🇦:</strong> 6%. Their situation is too unpredictable. They might have talented players, but the war and the constant need to rebuild makes them a long shot.
•   <strong>Sparta Prague 🇨🇿:</strong> 4%. The Czech league is improving, and they're usually the top team. Still, they're a level below the teams from the bigger leagues.
•   <strong>Rapid Wien 🇦🇹:</strong> 3%. They lack European quality players and will more than likely crash out with an early loss.
•   <strong>Rayo Vallecano 🇪🇸:</strong> 2%. The competition in La Liga is too fierce for them to realistically dedicate resources to a Conference League run.
•   <strong>Strasbourg 🇫🇷:</strong> 2%. With the right investment and a bit of luck, they might surprise some teams, but their consistency is questionable.

<strong>The Long Shots (Realistically No Chance):</strong>

•   <strong>Dynamo Kyiv 🇺🇦:</strong> 1%. Similar to Shakhtar, too much instability and disruption.
•   <strong>Legia Warsaw 🇵🇱:</strong> 0.5%. They're usually the best in Poland, but that's not saying much in a European context.
•   <strong>Lech Poznan 🇵🇱:</strong> 0.3%. The Polish league doesn't produce winners in Europe.
•   <strong>Shamrock Rovers 🇮🇪:</strong> 0.1%. Nice try, but the League of Ireland is too far behind.
•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava 🇸🇰:</strong> 0.1%. The Slovakian league isn't strong enough.
•   <strong>Omonia Nicosia 🇨🇾:</strong> 0.05%. They're the best in Cyprus, but that's not enough.
•   <strong>Jagiellonia 🇵🇱:</strong> 0.05%. Another Polish team? No chance.
•   <strong>Celje 🇸🇮:</strong> 0.02%. Slovenian football is not a force in Europe.
•   <strong>Rijeka 🇭🇷:</strong> 0.02%. The Croatian league is a bit better, but still...
•   <strong>Zrinjski Mostar 🇧🇦:</strong> 0.01%. Bosnia isn't going to produce a European champion anytime soon.
•   <strong>Lincoln Red Imps 🇬🇮:</strong> 0.001%. Gibraltar? Come on.
•   <strong>KuPS 🇫🇮:</strong> 0.001%. Finland? It's going to be a while.
•   <strong>AEK Athens 🇬🇷:</strong> 0.001%. The Greek league is falling apart.
•   <strong>Aberdeen 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 0.001%. Celtic and Rangers are a stretch. Aberdeen has no shot.
•   <strong>Drita 🇽🇰:</strong> 0.0001%. Kosovo? Not a chance.
•   <strong>Breiðablik 🇮🇸:</strong> 0.0001%. Iceland is cute, but they're not winning a European trophy.
•   <strong>Sigma Olomouc 🇨🇿:</strong> 0.0001%. Even worse than the other Czech teams.
•   <strong>Samsunspor 🇹🇷:</strong> 0.0001%. Turkey has some bigger teams with better chances.
•   <strong>Raków Częstochowa 🇵🇱:</strong> 0.0001%. Another Polish team that's going nowhere.
•   <strong>AEK Larnaca 🇨🇾:</strong> 0.0001%. Same as Omonia.
•   <strong>Shkëndija 🇲🇰:</strong> 0.0001%. North Macedonia? Zero chance.
•   <strong>Häcken 🇸🇪:</strong> 0.0001%. Sweden has some stronger teams, but still.
•   <strong>Lausanne-Sport 🇨🇭:</strong> 0.0001%. Swiss teams don't win European trophies.
•   <strong>Universitatea Craiova 🇷🇴:</strong> 0.0001%. Romanian football is struggling.
•   <strong>Hamrun Spartans 🇲🇹:</strong> 0.0001%. Malta? Get real.
•   <strong>Noah 🇦🇲:</strong> 0.0001%. Armenia isn't winning anything.
•   <strong>Shelbourne 🇮🇪:</strong> 0.0001%. Similar to Shamrock Rovers.

<strong>The Bottom Line:</strong>

The Conference League is still dominated by teams from the bigger leagues who either narrowly miss out on the Europa League or are on the rise. Don't expect a huge surprise winner. It's brutal, but that's the reality.</div>
