  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Milan squad for the 2025/26 season with no holds barred:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Manager - Massimiliano Allegri (🇮🇹):</strong> 7/10. He's a proven Serie A winner, but his tactics can be overly cautious and struggle to unlock stubborn defenses in Europe. He's decent but not world-class anymore.

•   <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Mike Maignan (🇫🇷):</strong> 9/10. Top-class keeper. One of the best in the world at his position. Dominant presence, excellent shot-stopper, and good with his feet.
•   <strong>Pietro Terracciano (🇮🇹):</strong> 5/10. A backup-level keeper. Provides decent cover but a clear downgrade from Maignan.
•   <strong>Lorenzo Torriani (🇮🇹):</strong> 4/10. A youth prospect, unlikely to make any significant impact at this level.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Fikayo Tomori (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 8/10. Quick, aggressive, and a solid defender. However, prone to occasional lapses in concentration.
•   <strong>Malick Thiaw (🇩🇪):</strong> 7/10. Promising young defender with good physical attributes. Still needs refinement in his decision-making.
•   <strong>Strahinja Pavlovic (🇷🇸):</strong> 6/10. A decent, physical defender. Not particularly mobile or elegant but reliable enough.
•   <strong>Matteo Gabbia (🇮🇹):</strong> 5/10. Squad player. Doesn't have the quality to consistently start for a top team.
•   <strong>Pervis Estupinan (🇪🇨):</strong> 7/10. Energetic wing-back. Good going forward but can be a liability defensively.
•   <strong>Davide Bartesaghi (🇮🇹):</strong> 5/10. Young player with potential. Needs time to develop.
•   <strong>Alex Jimenez (🇪🇸):</strong> 4/10. Another youth player. Unlikely to contribute much.
•   <strong>Filippo Terracciano (🇮🇹):</strong> 4/10. Same as Jimenez.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Ardon Jashari (🇨🇭):</strong> 7/10. Promising defensive midfielder. Good tackler and passer.
•   <strong>Samuele Ricci (🇮🇹):</strong> 7/10. Solid midfielder. Good technique and work rate.
•   <strong>Youssouf Fofana (🇫🇷):</strong> 7/10. Powerful midfielder. Brings energy and physicality to the team.
•   <strong>Ismael Bennacer (🇩🇿):</strong> 8/10. Excellent dribbler and passer. A creative force in midfield.
•   <strong>Yacine Adli (🇫🇷):</strong> 6/10. Decent player. Lacks the quality to be a key starter.
•   <strong>Yunus Musah (🇺🇸):</strong> 6/10. Energetic and versatile. Can play in multiple positions.
•   <strong>Ruben Loftus-Cheek (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Can be a useful squad player if he stays fit.
•   <strong>Warren Bondo (🇫🇷):</strong> 4/10. Youth player. Too early to judge.
•   <strong>Luka Modric (🇭🇷):</strong> 7/10. Past his prime. His age will be a liability, but still has moments of brilliance.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Rafael Leao (🇵🇹):</strong> 9/10. World-class winger. Explosive pace, great dribbling skills, and a goal threat. The star of the team.
•   <strong>Noah Okafor (🇨🇭):</strong> 7/10. Decent option as a backup attacker. Good pace and finishing ability.
•   <strong>Christian Pulisic (🇺🇸):</strong> 7/10. Talented player, but inconsistent. Often struggles with injuries.
•   <strong>Alexis Saelemaekers (🇧🇪):</strong> 6/10. Hardworking but lacks the quality to be a consistent starter for a team with ambitions.
•   <strong>Samuel Chukwueze (🇳🇬):</strong> 6/10. Can be unpredictable. Good dribbler, but inconsistent with his final product.
•   <strong>Santiago Gimenez (🇲🇽):</strong> 8/10. A decent striker that can be useful in front of the goal.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 6.5/10</strong>

<strong>Reasoning:</strong>

This squad is a mixed bag. They have some world-class players in Maignan and Leao, and decent talents in other positions. However, there are also significant weaknesses:

•   <strong>Defense:</strong> The defense is a bit shaky. While Tomori is good, the other defenders are inconsistent.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> The midfield is decent, but lacks a truly dominant force. Luka Modric is a great player, but he's aging and cannot be relied upon to carry the team.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> The attack is reliant on Leao. If he's off form or injured, the team struggles to create chances.

<strong>Conclusion:</strong>

This AC Milan squad is not a title contender for the Serie A or Champions League. They lack the depth and quality needed to compete with the best teams in Europe. Allegri's tactical approach might make them hard to beat at times, but ultimately, the team is too inconsistent and lacks a killer instinct to be considered a top team. They would likely finish in the top 4 in Serie A, but their Champions League run would probably end in the knockout stages.</div>
