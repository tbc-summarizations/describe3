  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest assessment of those Portuguese clubs, rated out of 10 for their overall standing within the country:

•   <strong>Arouca:</strong> 3/10. They're a yo-yo club, bouncing between leagues. No significant history, lack financial muscle.
•   <strong>AVS:</strong> 2/10. Let's be real, they're just another blip on the radar. Not impressive whatsoever.
•   <strong>Benfica:</strong> 9/10. One of the giants, historically dominant, but have bottled it too often lately. Still a force.
•   <strong>Boavista:</strong> 5/10. A mid-table team. Occasionally they'll have a good season.
•   <strong>Braga:</strong> 7/10. Often considered the "best of the rest" after the big three. They have decent talent but lack the consistency.
•   <strong>C.D. Nacional:</strong> 3/10. On the smaller side. Nothing particularly stands out.
•   <strong>Casa Pia:</strong> 4/10. Not historically relevant. They need to prove they're not just a flash in the pan.
•   <strong>Estoril:</strong> 4/10. They always seem to hover around the relegation zone.
•   <strong>Estrela Da Amadora:</strong> 3/10. Another team trying to re-establish themselves. Not much to write home about.
•   <strong>Famalicao:</strong> 4/10. They had a good run a few years ago, but are struggling now.
•   <strong>Farense:</strong> 3/10. Often in the second tier.
•   <strong>Gil Vicente:</strong> 4/10. Usually fighting to avoid relegation.
•   <strong>Moreirense:</strong> 3/10. Another lower-tier team with limited resources.
•   <strong>Porto:</strong> 9/10. A powerhouse. A consistent contender for titles, but sometimes fall short.
•   <strong>Rio Ave:</strong> 4/10. A team that struggles to stay in the top division.
•   <strong>Santa Clara:</strong> 3/10. Another small club.
•   <strong>Sporting CP:</strong> 8/10. A historical giant that is improving.
•   <strong>Vitoria S.C.:</strong> 6/10. Always solid, never spectacular.</div>
