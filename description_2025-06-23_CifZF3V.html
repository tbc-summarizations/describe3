  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This loss to Finland at Astana Arena on September 7, 2023, in the EURO Qualification Grp. H Round 5 is a bitter pill to swallow! As a devoted Kazakhstan supporter, watching our team, ranked 113th by FIFA, fall 0-1 to Finland, ranked 69th, is truly heartbreaking.

The match details highlight the painful truth: despite our team's valiant effort in a 3-4-3 formation under Magomed Adiev, with a team rating of 6.7/10, we couldn't find the back of the net. Our lineup, featuring key players like Igor Shatskiy, Nuraly Alip, and Bakhtiyar Zainutdinov, fought hard, but it wasn't enough to overcome Finland's defense.

Oliver Antman's goal in the 78th minute sealed our fate, earning him the Player of the Match title with an impressive 8.3/10 rating. Finland's 4-3-3 formation, led by Markku Kanerva, proved too strong, with a team rating of 7.2/10. Despite our substitutes' efforts, including Maksim Samorodov and Ramazan Orazov, we couldn't equalize.

This loss stings, especially knowing that a win could have significantly boosted our chances in the EURO Qualification journey. The disappointment is profound, but I remain a staunch supporter of our team. Onwards and upwards, Kazakhstan! We'll bounce back stronger and make our nation proud!</div>
