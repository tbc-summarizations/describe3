  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this tournament knockout stage.

<strong>Commentary on Results:</strong>

This knockout stage was full of upsets and some predictable outcomes. The Round of 16 saw the United States fall to Russia, a result that, frankly, isn't that shocking given the US's historical underperformance in major tournaments. Poland losing to Portugal isn't surprising either; Lewandowski can't carry the entire team. Germany's win over Finland was expected, as was Brazil's narrow victory against Norway.

However, Italy getting shut out by Chile is a massive disappointment. Italy, with their defensive pedigree, should never be held scoreless by Chile. England losing to France is also concerning, showing once again that England can't handle the pressure against top-tier teams. Spain crushing Ukraine was a foreseeable outcome. The Netherlands edging out Peru was an underwhelming performance, indicating potential struggles for the Dutch.

The Quarter-finals were equally interesting. Portugal defeating Russia was anticipated, and Germany dominating Chile only highlighted Italy's earlier failure against them. France overcoming Spain, though a close match, wasn't entirely surprising given France's firepower. Brazil's win over the Netherlands showed their resilience but also exposed their limitations.

The Semi-finals saw Portugal and France maintain their dominance, further suggesting that these two teams were the strongest contenders.

<strong>Final Prediction: Portugal vs. France</strong>

Portugal vs. France is going to be an absolute slugfest. Portugal's midfield is strong, and their attack, led by Ronaldo and Silva, is dangerous. However, France's overall squad depth and Mbappe's sheer brilliance will be the difference. France will likely win 2-1 in extra time, with Mbappe scoring the decisive goal.

<strong>Most Surprising Match Results:</strong>

1.  <strong>Italy 0-2 Chile:</strong> This result is downright embarrassing for Italy. A team with Italy's defensive legacy getting shut out like that is unacceptable. They should be ashamed.
2.  <strong>United States 1-2 Russia:</strong> The US always disappoints in big tournaments. Their performance lacks ambition and determination.
3.  <strong>England 1-2 France:</strong> This match showed that England has a long way to go before they can be considered a serious contender. They always bottle it.

<strong>Teams That Disappointed the Most:</strong>

1.  <strong>Italy:</strong> No question about it. Their performance against Chile was pathetic.
2.  <strong>England:</strong> Always hyped, always underperform. They need a major overhaul in tactics and mentality.
3.  <strong>United States:</strong> Consistently failing to live up to expectations. They need to stop relying on mediocrity and start developing real talent.

In summary, this tournament was a rollercoaster of expectations and disappointments, and the final promises to be a thrilling conclusion.</div>
