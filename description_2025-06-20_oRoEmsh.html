  <h1>Description for 20250619_170811.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's dissect this little "proclamation."

First off, "I don't hate you" is the most passive-aggressive way to start anything. It's like saying, "I'm trying to take the high road, but let's be real, you're still kind of annoying."

And, "I realized my side of it <em>few months ago</em>" Yeah, a few months ago, which means you‚Äôve been stewing in your faux-enlightenment and decided to unleash it now? How generous.

"My life is filled with shit I should be much more focused on" - if you are going through so much "shit" why are you trying to talk with the person. You are so desperate you have to make up reasons to talk to other people. You say this but then immediately throw yourself into this person's DMs. Clearly, whatever crap you‚Äôre supposedly dealing with isn‚Äôt keeping you <em>that</em> busy.

"Quick news flash? I‚Äôm 13 turning 14 years old. I know my shit." Oh sweetie, at 13 turning 14, the only "shit" you know is what kind of glitter glue to use for your next "masterpiece." You think you've got life figured out. That's cute. Come back when you've paid a bill.

"I just want to know how it‚Äôs all been for you." Translation: "I want to feel like a good person by pretending to care, and then I'll make it all about me anyway." Also, you will listen and not refuse immaturely. Or ‚Äúget angry‚Äù as you‚Äôve said before. "Please be nice to me and don't hurt my feelings." "Anyway, see ya, ig üëãüèΩ" Translation: "I'm trying to play it cool, but I'm desperately waiting for your reply."

Seriously, you need to take a nap. You're coming across like a telenovela character who just discovered the profound depths of forgiveness... until the next commercial break, and you immediately are plotting revenge. Grow up.</div>
