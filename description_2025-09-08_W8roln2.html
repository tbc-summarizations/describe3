  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those matches, no sugarcoating:

•   <strong>Belarus 0-1 Netherlands:</strong> Belarus, what a pathetic performance. Losing 1-0 at home? Might as well not even show up to the pitch. Netherlands, congrats on the win, but barely scraping by against Belarus? Get your act together.

•   <strong>Scotland 2-0 Norway:</strong> Scotland, finally showing some fight! A solid 2-0 win. Norway, you've got Haaland and still can't score? Get it together.

•   <strong>Cyprus 0-2 Italy:</strong> Cyprus, another expected loss. Italy, you should be ashamed you didn't crush them by more.

•   <strong>Kosovo 2-4 Slovakia:</strong> Kosovo, you can't even defend on your home court. Slovakia, decent win, but don't get too excited, it was just Kosovo.

•   <strong>Iceland 2-1 France:</strong> Iceland pulling off a shock win? Good for you. France, what a joke. Losing to Iceland? Pack your bags and go home.

•   <strong>Faroe Islands 0-3 Sweden:</strong> Faroe Islands, what did you expect? Sweden, finally beating a team you should be beating.

•   <strong>Andorra 1-2 Belgium:</strong> Andorra, at least you scored a goal. Belgium, this performance is terrible for a powerhouse.

•   <strong>Israel 2-0 Russia:</strong> Israel, finally doing something right. Russia, get your act together.

•   <strong>Czechia 1-2 Portugal:</strong> Czechia almost won, but failed again. Portugal, barely scraping by against Czechia? You should be ashamed.

•   <strong>Albania 1-0 Liechtenstein:</strong> Albania, great job on the win. Liechtenstein, you were a disappointment again.

•   <strong>Armenia 1-4 Switzerland:</strong> Armenia, complete disgrace on the field. Switzerland, just as expected.

•   <strong>Serbia 1-0 Moldova:</strong> Serbia, a win is a win. Moldova, might as well not show up to the pitch.

•   <strong>Ukraine 0-2 England:</strong> Ukraine, you are a disgrace. England is just playing at a different level.

•   <strong>Luxembourg 3-1 Finland:</strong> Luxembourg, showing some serious fight! Finland, absolute embarrassment.

•   <strong>Azerbaijan 1-3 Hungary:</strong> Azerbaijan, a terrible loss. Hungary, a win is a win.

•   <strong>Gibraltar 0-3 Poland:</strong> Gibraltar, you are a team that should not even be considered as part of the EU qualifiers. Poland, do better.

•   <strong>Northern Ireland 0-1 Croatia:</strong> Northern Ireland, disappointing. Croatia, a win is a win.

•   <strong>Malta 0-2 Denmark:</strong> Malta, shocking again. Denmark, could be better.

•   <strong>San Marino 0-2 Spain:</strong> San Marino, is it even a surprise? Spain, good job on beating a team with a -2 goal difference.

•   <strong>Bosnia 3-0 Georgia:</strong> Bosnia, good job on the win. Georgia, get out of here.

•   <strong>Estonia 1-2 Germany:</strong> Estonia, you did not disappoint again. Germany, do better.

•   <strong>Turkey 2-0 Ireland:</strong> Turkey, an excellent win. Ireland, back to where you were.</div>
