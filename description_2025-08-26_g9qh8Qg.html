  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you want my take on these "albums" as if I were living in the 1930s? Here's what I think:

•   *<em>Björk - </em>Vespertine<em><strong>: Utterly bizarre. Sounds like noises emanating from an asylum, a collection of blips and burps. This isn't music; it's an insult to the great composers. 1/10.

•   </strong>David Bowie - </em>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars<em><strong>: This sounds like some vaudeville act gone horribly wrong. The man sings as if he's got a frog in his throat, and the lyrics are nothing but gibberish. 2/10.

•   </strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - </em>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven<em><strong>: This is just dreadful, formless noise. A cacophony of instruments, building to some unholy crescendo. This music sounds like the end of the world is nigh. 0/10.

•   </strong>Have a Nice Life - </em>Deathconsciousness<em><strong>: Depressing and morbid. The music is lethargic and seems intent on dragging the listener into the depths of despair. 1/10.

•   </strong>Jeff Buckley - </em>Grace<em><strong>: Overwrought and histrionic. This young man has a fine voice, but he seems determined to wail and screech his way through every song. Less melodrama, more artistry, please! 4/10.

•   </strong>Kendrick Lamar - </em>To Pimp a Butterfly<em><strong>: Jarring and unpleasant. This "jazz" and "hip-hop" amalgamation is nothing but rhythmic shouting over a mishmash of clashing sounds. A waste of talent. 2/10.

•   </strong>King Crimson - </em>In the Court of the Crimson King<em><strong>: Bombastic and pretentious. This band seems determined to prove how clever they are, but the result is a confusing mess of noise. 3/10.

•   </strong>Lauryn Hill - </em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill<em><strong>: A confused mix of styles. The girl has a nice voice, but the songs are meandering and unfocused. Needs more discipline. 4/10.

•   </strong>Madvillain - </em>Madvillainy<em><strong>: Sloppy and incoherent. This "rap" music is just a bunch of mumbled words over a scratchy record. A complete waste of time. 1/10.

•   </strong>Marvin Gaye - </em>What's Going On<em><strong>: A bit too modern for my tastes. The man has a good voice, but the songs are repetitive, and the lyrics are a bit too preachy. 5/10.

•   </strong>Mingus - </em>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady<em><strong>: Chaotic and unsettling. This "jazz" music is all over the place, with no discernible melody or structure. A complete mess. 2/10.

•   </strong>Nas - </em>Illmatic<em><strong>: Harsh and vulgar. This "rap" music is full of ugly language and violent imagery. It's a disgrace to the art form. 1/10.

•   </strong>Pink Floyd - </em>Wish You Were Here<em><strong>: Spacey and meandering. This music seems to drift off into the ether, with no clear direction or purpose. 3/10.

•   </strong>Prince and the Revolution - </em>Purple Rain<em><strong>: Flashy and oversexed. The man has talent, but he seems more interested in showing off than in making good music. A bit too scandalous for my tastes. 4/10.

•   </strong>Radiohead - </em>In Rainbows<em><strong>: Dreary and depressing. This music is like a wet blanket, dragging the listener down into the depths of despair. 2/10.

•   </strong>Stevie Wonder - </em>Songs in the Key of Life<em><strong>: Pleasant but overlong. The man is talented, but the album is far too long and rambling. Needs some editing. 6/10.

•   </strong>System of a Down - </em>Toxicity<em><strong>: Loud and obnoxious. This "rock" music is just a bunch of screaming and shouting. A complete assault on the ears. 1/10.

•   </strong>The Beatles - </em>Abbey Road<em><strong>: Catchy but simplistic. These young men have a knack for writing catchy tunes, but their music lacks depth and sophistication. 5/10.

•   </strong>The Microphones - </em>The Glow, Pt. 2<em><strong>: Monotonous and dreary. This music seems to drone on and on, with no discernible melody or structure. Utterly boring. 1/10.

•   </strong>Wu-Tang Clan - </em>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)***: Barbaric and offensive. This "rap" music is full of violence, vulgarity, and misogyny. A disgrace to society. 0/10.

In conclusion, most of this modern "music" is a far cry from the classics of my day. Give me a good melody and some meaningful lyrics any day!</div>
