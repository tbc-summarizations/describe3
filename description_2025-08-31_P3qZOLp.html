  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get into these Danny Brown albums. Here's my Drake-style rating:

•   <strong>The Hybrid:</strong> 5/10. Early Danny, ya know? Got potential, but it's still rough around the edges. Needs some polish.

•   <strong>XXX:</strong> 9/10. This is where he started cooking. Raw energy, crazy flows. Certified banger.

•   <strong>Old:</strong> 7/10. Took some risks on this one. Some hits, some misses. Still got that Danny vibe, but maybe a little too experimental for me.

•   <strong>Atrocity Exhibition:</strong> 10/10. This is that DARK. That REAL. Danny at his peak, going deep. Respect.

•   <strong>uknowhatimsayin¿:</strong> 6/10. Easy listen. Not a ton of replay value. Solid but not too much of a banger.

•   <strong>SCARING THE HOES:</strong> 3/10. Can't lie to you, this aint for me dawg. That production is crazy, but it gets corny quick

•   <strong>Quaranta:</strong> 8/10. He back! This that Danny I like. Real raps. I like the beats, nothing too complex.</div>
