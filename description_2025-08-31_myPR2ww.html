  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here comes the brutally honest Nickelback take on OutKast's discography:

•   <strong>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik: 5/10</strong> - It's like early days, finding their sound. Still kinda rough around the edges, ya know? Sounds like something you'd hear blasting out of a busted Cadillac at a gas station.

•   <strong>ATLiens: 8/10</strong> - Alright, now we're talking. They started getting experimental on this one, and I like it. Production isn't the best and lyrics are ok though.

•   <strong>Aquemini: 9/10</strong> - This is where OutKast figured it out. Lyrics are good, production is amazing and very unique.

•   <strong>Stankonia: 7/10</strong> - It's got some energy, some raw emotion, but it's kinda all over the place. "Ms. Jackson" is alright, but the rest is skipable.

•   <strong>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below: 3/10</strong> - This is where they lost me. A bunch of nonsense. I want Rock, not this garbage.

•   <strong>Idlewild: 1/10</strong> - This sounds like garbage. The production is weird and the lyrics are trash.</div>
