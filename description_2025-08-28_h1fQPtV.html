  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of each team's chances to win the 2025-26 Champions League, based on current form, potential growth, financial power, and historical performance. I'm not holding back, so buckle up.

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain (🇫🇷): 18%</strong> - They've got the money, but their mentality is consistently suspect. If they finally manage to build a cohesive team around a superstar, they are title contenders. But until then, they're just a collection of individuals who are all show, no substance.

•   <strong>Real Madrid (🇪🇸): 15%</strong> - They're Real Madrid. Even when they look down and out, they always find a way to compete. Their experience and sheer force of will cannot be underestimated, plus they have the richest history in this competition.

•   <strong>Manchester City (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 20%</strong> - As long as Pep Guardiola is there, they're always a threat. Their infrastructure is top-notch, they have money to burn, and their tactics are innovative. They are the best in the world as it stands.

•   <strong>Bayern Munich (🇩🇪): 12%</strong> - They're Bayern. German efficiency personified. However, their dominance in Germany has made them complacent in Europe. They need a major shakeup to recapture their former glory.

•   <strong>Liverpool (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 9%</strong> - Klopp is gone, it seems like their team is completely dismantled and gone with him. They are mid table team if nothing changes drastically.

•   <strong>Inter Milan (🇮🇹): 5%</strong> - Solid team, but they lack the financial firepower to truly compete with the top dogs. They might make a run, but winning it all is a stretch.

•   <strong>Chelsea (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 4%</strong> - They are a disaster with no direction. So spending billions without a clear plan won't get you there.

•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund (🇩🇪): 3%</strong> - They're a good team that develops great players, but they always seem to fall short when it matters most. They're a stepping stone for bigger clubs.

•   <strong>Barcelona (🇪🇸): 5%</strong> - A long way from their peak, but they have potential. If they can sort out their finances and rebuild properly, they could be a force again. But that's a big "if."

•   <strong>Arsenal (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 7%</strong> - Good team under Arteta, but they lack the killer instinct needed to win the Champions League. They need more experience.

•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen (🇩🇪): 4%</strong> - They're fun to watch, but they are not at all consistent.

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid (🇪🇸): 3%</strong> - Simeone's defensive tactics can only take them so far. They're tough to beat, but they lack the attacking flair to win the whole thing.

•   <strong>Benfica (🇵🇹): 1%</strong> - Good for developing young talent, but not built to win the Champions League.

•   <strong>Atalanta (🇮🇹): 1%</strong> - Gasperini's attacking style is entertaining, but they're too inconsistent to win it all.

•   <strong>Villarreal (🇪🇸): 1%</strong> - They are very underwhelming in every way.

•   <strong>Juventus (🇮🇹): 2%</strong> - They are struggling to rebuild after years of mismanagement. They need time to recover.

•   <strong>Eintracht Frankfurt (🇩🇪): 0.5%</strong> - A surprise package, but they lack the resources to compete at the highest level consistently.

•   <strong>Club Brugge (🇧🇪): 0.1%</strong> - They are a nobody with almost no chance.

•   <strong>Tottenham Hotspur (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 2%</strong> - Spursy. Enough said. They are never going to win a trophy like that.

•   <strong>PSV Eindhoven (🇳🇱): 0.1%</strong> - They are like Club Brugge, a nobody with almost no chance.

•   <strong>Ajax (🇳🇱): 0.2%</strong> - Their youth academy is great, but they are too good to be in Ajax and are always in bigger clubs.

•   <strong>Napoli (🇮🇹): 3%</strong> - They need to prove that their title-winning season wasn't a fluke. They have potential, but they need more consistency.

•   <strong>Sporting CP (🇵🇹): 0.1%</strong> - Not a chance to even participate.

•   <strong>Olympiacos (🇬🇷): 0%</strong> - Not a chance.

•   <strong>Slavia Prague (🇨🇿): 0%</strong> - Absolutely no chance.

•   <strong>Bodø/Glimt (🇳🇴): 0%</strong> - They're not even a team.

•   <strong>Marseille (🇫🇷): 0.3%</strong> - They will never get to even quarterfinals.

•   <strong>Copenhagen (🇩🇰): 0%</strong> - Another nobody, no chance whatsoever.

•   <strong>Monaco (🇫🇷): 0.4%</strong> - They are a mediocre club.

•   <strong>Galatasaray (🇹🇷): 0%</strong> - Never going to happen.

•   <strong>Union Saint-Gilloise (🇧🇪): 0%</strong> - No comment.

•   <strong>Qarabağ (🇦🇿): 0%</strong> - You must be kidding.

•   <strong>Athletic Bilbao (🇪🇸): 0.2%</strong> - Do not waste my time.

•   <strong>Newcastle United (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿): 4%</strong> - Their money will help them but they need to build a cohesive squad.

•   <strong>Pafos (🇨🇾): 0%</strong> - Are you serious?

•   <strong>Kairat (🇰🇿): 0%</strong> - They won't even qualify.

There you have it. A brutally honest assessment. Some teams have a chance, but most are just making up the numbers.</div>
