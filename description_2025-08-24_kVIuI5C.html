  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get brutally honest about these Champions League playoff second legs.

<strong>Ferencváros vs. Qarabağ:</strong>
•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Ferencváros 2 - 1 Qarabağ
•   <strong>Analysis:</strong> Qarabağ has a comfortable lead, but Ferencváros will throw everything they have at this game. They're at home and will push hard. However, Qarabağ is too disciplined and will probably score again which will see them get through on aggregate but Ferencvaros will win the match

<strong>Red Star Belgrade vs. Pafos:</strong>
•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Red Star Belgrade 3 - 1 Pafos
•   <strong>Analysis:</strong> Red Star Belgrade are a big club and they won't go out in the qualifying rounds. They will play a very hard fought game that will see them winning at home with ease.

<strong>Bodø/Glimt vs. Sturm Graz:</strong>
•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Bodø/Glimt 1 - 0 Sturm Graz
•   <strong>Analysis:</strong> This tie is already over. Bodø/Glimt are far superior, and they will simply control the game and ensure no shocking comeback. The Sturm Graz players will give up as it is pointless.

<strong>Celtic vs. Kairat:</strong>
•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Celtic 2 - 0 Kairat
•   <strong>Analysis:</strong> Celtic at home are a different beast. Their fans will create a hostile atmosphere, and Celtic's superior quality will shine through. Kairat will buckle under the pressure.

<strong>Basel vs. Copenhagen:</strong>
•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Basel 1 - 2 Copenhagen (After Extra Time)
•   <strong>Analysis:</strong> This is the tightest of the lot. Both teams are evenly matched. Copenhagen will win in extra time as they are slightly better.

<strong>Fenerbahçe vs. Benfica:</strong>
•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Fenerbahçe 1 - 1 Benfica
•   <strong>Analysis:</strong> This match will be a tough one for both sides, but Benfica are simply better and will get a 1-1 draw to advance to the next stage.

<strong>Rangers vs. Club Brugge:</strong>
•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Rangers 2 - 1 Club Brugge
•   <strong>Analysis:</strong> Rangers will have a good game at home and manage to win but they won't score enough to make the difference. Club Brugge will go through as they are more than likely to score away to send Rangers home.</div>
