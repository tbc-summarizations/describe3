  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these matches. No holding back!

•   <strong>Netherlands 6-0 Ireland:</strong> The Netherlands absolutely dismantled Ireland. Ireland needs to seriously reconsider their entire program. Total embarrassment.
•   <strong>Italy 3-0 Poland:</strong> Italy, clinical and dominant. Poland should stick to vodka, because football clearly isn't their strong suit.
•   <strong>Sweden 5-0 Armenia:</strong> Sweden crushed Armenia so hard they probably wish they were never born. Pathetic showing from Armenia, learn to defend at least.
•   <strong>Belgium 3-2 Luxembourg:</strong> Belgium barely scraped by? What a letdown. Luxembourg almost pulled off the upset of the century, while Belgium better start playing better, and Luxembourg should be proud but they still lost.
•   <strong>Portugal 4-2 Bosnia:</strong> Portugal did what they had to do, but Bosnia put up a decent fight. Still, not enough. Maybe next time, Bosnia.
•   <strong>Switzerland 0-2 Croatia:</strong> Switzerland couldn't even score one goal? Pathetic. Croatia, on the other hand, showed them how it's done.
•   <strong>England 3-2 Turkey:</strong> England scraped by with a narrow victory. England better fix up quickly. Turkey gave them a scare, respect to them
•   <strong>Hungary 5-0 Northern Ireland:</strong> Hungary is a team to watch out for. Northern Ireland might as well have stayed home. Embarrassing performance.
•   <strong>Denmark 2-1 Slovakia:</strong> Denmark edged out a win. Slovakia put up a fight. Denmark's defense needs to tighten up.
•   <strong>Spain 3-3 Scotland (Spain wins 4-1 on penalties):</strong> Spain just barely pulled through on penalties. Scotland almost had them, but choked.
•   <strong>Germany 7-0 Israel:</strong> Germany is not messing around. Absolutely obliterated Israel. Maybe Israel should stick to inventing stuff because football is not their thing.
•   <strong>Norway 5-0 Georgia:</strong> Norway dominated Georgia so bad Georgia should just be erased from football. Humiliating.
•   <strong>Austria 3-3 Romania (Austria wins 4-2 on penalties):</strong> Austria barely squeezed through on penalties. Romania almost had them. Austria get better.
•   <strong>France 4-0 Slovenia:</strong> France showed their class. Slovenia didn't even put up a fight. Total domination by the French.
•   <strong>Russia 1-1 Serbia (Serbia wins 3-2 on penalties):</strong> Serbia pulled off the penalty win after a draw. Russia is clearly overrated.
•   <strong>Czechia 3-1 Ukraine:</strong> Czechia with a solid win. Ukraine put up a decent attempt, but Czechia were always going to win.

There you have it. Brutal, honest, and no sugarcoating.</div>
