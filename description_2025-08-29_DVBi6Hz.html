  <h1>Description for 220px-UEFA_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not mincing words here. Here are my brutally honest predictions for the September 2026 World Cup Qualifiers, based on current team strengths, historical performance, and a healthy dose of cynicism:

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Luxembourg 🇱🇺 vs. Northern Ireland 🇬🇧:</strong> 0-1. Northern Ireland are painfully mediocre, but Luxembourg's never been that good. Expect a dire, scrappy affair.
•   <strong>Slovakia 🇸🇰 vs. Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> 1-3. Germany, despite recent struggles, still has far more talent. Slovakia might put up a fight, but the Germans will eventually wear them down.
•   <strong>Luxembourg 🇱🇺 vs. Slovakia 🇸🇰:</strong> 0-2. Slovakia have a decent team so should win.
•   <strong>Germany 🇩🇪 vs. Northern Ireland 🇬🇧:</strong> 4-0. Germany will want to show their dominant side after the tough match previously.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮 vs. Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> 1-1. Slovenia have a good team but Sweden has Zlatan.
•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 vs. Kosovo 🇽🇰:</strong> 3-0. Switzerland will be ruthless.
•   <strong>Kosovo 🇽🇰 vs. Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> 0-2. Sweden, despite their inconsistencies, should have enough quality to win. Expect some desperate defending from Kosovo.
•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 vs. Slovenia 🇸🇮:</strong> 2-1. Switzerland are strong, organized, and often underestimated. Slovenia will struggle to break them down.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷 vs. Belarus 🇧🇾:</strong> 2-0. Greece are the favorites.
•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 vs. Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 3-1. Denmark are strong.
•   <strong>Belarus 🇧🇾 vs. Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 0-2. Belarus is not a good team.
•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷 vs. Denmark 🇩🇰:</strong> 1-2. Denmark just has more quality and tactical flexibility. Greece is tough at home, but Denmark will find a way.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>Iceland 🇮🇸 vs. Azerbaijan 🇦🇿:</strong> 2-1. Iceland's home advantage and fighting spirit will be the difference.
•   <strong>Ukraine 🇺🇦 vs. France 🇫🇷:</strong> 0-3. France will win.
•   <strong>Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 vs. Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> 0-2. Ukraine will want revenge for the game previously.
•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 vs. Iceland 🇮🇸:</strong> 4-0. Iceland will be outmatched.

<strong>Group E</strong>

•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪 vs. Turkey 🇹🇷:</strong> 0-1. Georgia has the attacking ability, but I don't see them able to keep a clean sheet.
•   <strong>Bulgaria 🇧🇬 vs. Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> 0-5. Spain will be ruthless.
•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪 vs. Bulgaria 🇧🇬:</strong> 2-0.
•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 vs. Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> 1-3. Spain, despite recent hiccups, still has a squad full of technically gifted players. Turkey might get a goal, but their defense won't hold up.

<strong>Group F</strong>

•   <strong>Armenia 🇦🇲 vs. Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> 0-4. Portugal will be relentless.
•   <strong>Ireland 🇮🇪 vs. Hungary 🇭🇺:</strong> 1-1. A dull, scrappy draw.
•   <strong>Armenia 🇦🇲 vs. Ireland 🇮🇪:</strong> 1-0.
•   <strong>Hungary 🇭🇺 vs. Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> 1-3. Portugal are strong.

<strong>Group G</strong>

•   <strong>Lithuania 🇱🇹 vs. Malta 🇲🇹:</strong> 1-0. A truly awful match that neither side deserves to win.
•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 3-1. The Netherlands, despite their occasional collapses, are simply a better team. Poland relies too much on Lewandowski.
•   <strong>Lithuania 🇱🇹 vs. Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> 0-4.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱 vs. Finland 🇫🇮:</strong> 2-0.

<strong>Group H</strong>

•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹 vs. Cyprus 🇨🇾:</strong> 3-0. Austria.
•   <strong>San Marino 🇸🇲 vs. Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 0-5. One of the greatest goal difference wins ever.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦 vs. Austria 🇦🇹:</strong> 1-2.
•   <strong>Cyprus 🇨🇾 vs. Romania 🇷🇴:</strong> 0-2.

<strong>Group I</strong>

•   <strong>Moldova 🇲🇩 vs. Israel 🇮🇱:</strong> 0-1.
•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 vs. Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 4-0. Italy are simply more talented.
•   <strong>Israel 🇮🇱 vs. Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> 1-2. Italy will be clinical in front of goal.
•   <strong>Norway 🇳🇴 vs. Moldova 🇲🇩:</strong> 3-0. Norway is not good, but has enough skill to win.

<strong>Group J</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 vs. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> 0-2. The magic won't continue.
•   <strong>Liechtenstein 🇱🇮 vs. Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong> 0-6.
•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰 vs. Liechtenstein 🇱🇮:</strong> 4-0.
•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 vs. Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 5-0. Belgium have a stronger team so they will be able to put in plenty of goals.

<strong>Group K</strong>

•   <strong>Latvia 🇱🇻 vs. Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 0-3.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 vs. Andorra 🇦🇩:</strong> 7-0.
•   <strong>Albania 🇦🇱 vs. Latvia 🇱🇻:</strong> 2-0.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 vs. England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 1-2. England are a stronger team on paper so should win, although it's not an easy game at all.

<strong>Group L</strong>

•   <strong>Faroe Islands 🇫🇴 vs. Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> 0-3.
•   <strong>Montenegro 🇲🇪 vs. Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> 1-1. This screams a dull, tactical draw.
•   <strong>Gibraltar 🇬🇮 vs. Faroe Islands 🇫🇴:</strong> 0-1.
•   <strong>Croatia 🇭🇷 vs. Montenegro 🇲🇪:</strong> 2-0. Croatia, despite their aging stars, still have the quality to control this game. Montenegro won't be a pushover, but they lack the firepower to truly threaten.

There you have it. I've been honest, brutally so, and hopefully, I've given you the detailed predictions you wanted.</div>
