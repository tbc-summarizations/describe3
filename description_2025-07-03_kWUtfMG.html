  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back:

1.  <strong>KS Lechia:</strong> Oh look, a Polish club with a flag so generic, it could be mistaken for a discount airline logo. They probably play in a stadium built by communist leftovers, and their fans probably sing songs about how they used to be good.
2.  <strong>Clube Ferroviario:</strong> A train on their crest? Seriously? Do they play their matches on a railway track? Their glory days probably ended when steam engines went out of style. I bet their star striker has a gut bigger than the locomotive on their logo.
3.  <strong>Slough Town F.C.:</strong> A coat of arms? In a town known for its industrial estates and a bleak existence? It's like putting lipstick on a pig. They're probably still celebrating their last win, which I bet was against a team of retirees.
4.  <strong>AC Milan (x2):</strong> Oh, look who it is. Used to be big, now they're just coasting on past glory, like an aging rockstar selling out arenas on nostalgia. They've got more money than sense, and their current squad is probably more interested in their hairstyles than winning trophies. At least both logos of them are beautiful, i'll give them that.
5.  <strong>Evil Football Club:</strong> I am pretty sure this isn't a real football club. They probably have 5 players that get injured within the first minute.
6.  <strong>FC Atyrau:</strong> Another club from a random middle-of-nowhere country. Atyrau looks more like a brand of cheap bottled water than a football club.
7.  <strong>Mohun Bagan:</strong> Another football club that probably is not that good. Logo looks horrible with the colours, font and the weird tree in the middle.
8.  <strong>AFC:</strong> Basic initials. Really unoriginal. Looks like they stole the colour scheme from a children's cartoon.
9.  <strong>Borussia Dortmund (Modified):</strong> Ah, Dortmund! I like this one... except what the hell is that in the background? They have a swastika. Absolutely disgusting. It's like they're trying to be edgy, but they just ended up offending everyone.

In conclusion, football is a joke, but these teams make it easier to laugh.</div>
