  <div class="discord-text">Creating 128 groups of 64 teams for a UEFA Champions League draw isn't possible for a few reasons:

•   <strong>Number of Teams:</strong> The UEFA Champions League involves significantly fewer teams than the thousands that this scenario would require.
•   <strong>Tournament Structure:</strong> The competition has a fixed structure with a group stage followed by knockout rounds, which wouldn't work with this many groups.

However, here's a fictional, simplified version based on a smaller scale, similar to the current Champions League format:

<strong>Example (Simplified) Group Stage Draw</strong>

Let's assume we're dealing with 32 teams, divided into 8 groups of 4. Here's a random, hypothetical draw:

•   <strong>Group A:</strong> Real Madrid, Manchester United, Napoli, Red Star Belgrade
•   <strong>Group B:</strong> Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Porto, Galatasaray
•   <strong>Group C:</strong> Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Benfica, Celtic
•   <strong>Group D:</strong> Liverpool, Atletico Madrid, Ajax, Club Brugge
•   <strong>Group E:</strong> Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Salzburg, Shakhtar Donetsk
•   <strong>Group F:</strong> Arsenal, AC Milan, Feyenoord, Young Boys
•   <strong>Group G:</strong> Manchester City, Sevilla, RB Leipzig, Crvena Zvezda
•   <strong>Group H:</strong> Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio, Copenhagen

<strong>Explanation of Real UEFA Champions League Draw</strong>

•   <strong>Seeding:</strong> Teams are usually divided into pots based on their UEFA club coefficient rankings. The top teams are in Pot 1, and so on.
•   <strong>Drawing:</strong> One team is drawn from each pot to form a group.
•   <strong>Restrictions:</strong> Teams from the same country can't be drawn into the same group. There may be other restrictions related to political situations.</div>
