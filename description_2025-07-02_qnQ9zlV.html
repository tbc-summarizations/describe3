  <h1>Description for 40px-Flag_of_Cyprus.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of the Cyprus squad, position by position, and then an overall team rating:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Konstantinos Panagi:</strong> 4/10 - Inconsistent and prone to errors. Not a reliable option.
•   <strong>Joel Mall:</strong> 4/10 - A journeyman keeper, not a top-tier talent. Just filling a spot.
•   <strong>Neofytos Michail:</strong> 3/10 - Probably third choice for a reason. Doesn't inspire much confidence.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Konstantinos Laifis:</strong> 6/10 - Probably the best defender in the squad, has some quality, but still makes mistakes.
•   <strong>Nicholas Ioannou:</strong> 5/10 - Average at best, struggles against quality opposition.
•   <strong>Andreas Karo:</strong> 4/10 - Not good enough for international football, gets caught out of position too often.
•   <strong>Stelios Andreou:</strong> 3/10 - Lacks pace and is easily beaten by quick attackers.
•   <strong>Minas Antoniou:</strong> 3/10 - Simply not at the level required.
•   <strong>Nikolas Panagiotou:</strong> 3/10 - A very uninspiring defender.
•   <strong>Anderson Correia:</strong> 4/10 - Slow and lacks technical ability.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Grigoris Kastanos:</strong> 5/10 - Flashes of brilliance but lacks consistency.
•   <strong>Kostakis Artymatas:</strong> 5/10 - A decent defensive midfielder, but limited in his passing range.
•   <strong>Charalampos Kyriakou:</strong> 4/10 - Lacks creativity and attacking threat.
•   <strong>Ioannis Kousoulos:</strong> 5/10 - A grafter in midfield, but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Alex Gogic:</strong> 6/10 - A solid defensive presence, but can be slow on the ball.
•   <strong>Charalampos Charalampous:</strong> 4/10 - Not good enough for this level.
•   <strong>Danilo Spoljaric:</strong> 3/10 - Limited impact, doesn't offer much.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Pieros Sotiriou:</strong> 6/10 - Their main goal threat, but inconsistent form lets him down.
•   <strong>Ioannis Pittas:</strong> 5/10 - Decent work rate but lacks the killer instinct.
•   <strong>Andronikos Kakoullis:</strong> 4/10 - Not clinical enough in front of goal.
•   <strong>Loizos Loizou:</strong> 6/10 - A promising young player with some pace and skill.
•   <strong>Marinos Tzionis:</strong> 4/10 - Lacks end product and consistency.
•   <strong>Marios Ilia:</strong> 3/10 - Doesn't offer much.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>4/10</strong>

This is a weak squad with limited quality in most positions. They lack a genuine goalscorer, their defense is shaky, and their midfield is uninspired. They will struggle against any decent opposition and are likely to be a whipping boy in any qualifying group. Expect a lot of losses and very few moments of brilliance. They are quite frankly an extremely poor team.</div>
