  <h1>Description for 81.png, 180.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's be brutally honest here. Looking at these lineups, Uzbekistan is going to dismantle Kazakhstan. 

Here's the breakdown:

•   <strong>Uzbekistan's Attack:</strong> Shomurodov is a genuine threat, and the support from Urunov and Khamdamov adds creativity. Kazakhstan's defense, with all due respect, is going to struggle immensely containing that firepower. Their midfield won't offer enough protection.

•   <strong>Uzbekistan's Midfield:</strong> Ganiev and Khamrobekov are solid, and Fayzullaev provides a spark of quality. They'll control the midfield battle against Kazakhstan's slightly less experienced midfield trio.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan's Attack:</strong> Satpaev and Samorodov aren't exactly household names. They'll have a tough time breaking down Uzbekistan's defense. Zuev might offer a bit of pace, but it won't be enough.

<strong>Prediction: Kazakhstan 0 - 4 Uzbekistan</strong>

Uzbekistan will dominate possession, create numerous chances, and Shomurodov will likely get on the scoresheet. Kazakhstan might get a few hopeful shots off, but nothing substantial enough to really trouble Nematov. It will be a very one-sided game. Uzbekistan is the much stronger side and their victory would be well-deserved.</div>
