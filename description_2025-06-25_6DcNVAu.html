  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this sorry excuse of a Nations League B group.

<strong>Czechia:</strong> Let's be real, Czechia only made it out because everyone else was even more pathetic. They started strong by getting promoted to the League A but a loss to Georgia 4-1 in the first matchday is not a good way to start your Nations League campaign, and their inconsistency is appalling. Barely deserving promotion but hey, congratulations on the bare minimum.

<strong>Ukraine:</strong> What a disappointment. Supposedly a team on the rise, and they barely scrape into the promotion play-offs? Losing to Albania in the first matchday? And what's with the goal difference being zero? They are just mediocre. I don't see them doing anything in the play-offs either.

<strong>Georgia:</strong> Started strong with a 4-1 win against Czechia but all they had to do was win against Albania for qualification for promotion to the League A, but they lost 0-1, what a joke. Also got beat by Ukraine. Another team with zero consistency.

<strong>Albania:</strong> Relegated? Serves them right. Their "attack" is an absolute joke. Four goals in six games? They might as well not even bother showing up. Good riddance to League C, where they belong, they even lost to Ukraine which is embarrassing.</div>
