  <h1>Description for top_10_fav_clubs.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cut through the BS and get to the prime eras of these clubs, based on what I know and generally accepted football history.

•   <strong>FC Atyrau:</strong> Let's be real, they've never had a "prime era" in the sense of dominating globally. Any success is likely confined to domestic Kazakh football.
•   <strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong> Their prime was definitely under Diego Simeone. 2013-2014 season winning La Liga and reaching the Champions League final. That period of grit, defensive solidity, and counter-attacking brilliance was peak Atleti.
•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> Right now. Pep Guardiola's era. Utter domination in the Premier League, scoring records, and a distinct style of play that most teams can't even begin to replicate. There was also the late 60s/early 70s with Mercer and Allison but now its the best we've seen.
•   <strong>AC Milan:</strong> The late 80s and early 90s under Sacchi and Capello. Van Basten, Gullit, Rijkaard. Dominating European football with innovative tactics and a squad of legends.
•   <strong>Besiktas:</strong> The mid 2010s with players like Aboubakar, Quaresma and Talisca are some of the best football Besiktas have played.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> They've got several. The Beckenbauer era in the 70s, the early 2000s with Hitzfeld, and obviously the more recent dominance under Guardiola and the treble-winning season under Flick.
•   <strong>Qarabag:</strong> Similar to Atyrau, their "prime" is relative. Their most successful period is probably their recent run of consistent qualification for the Europa League and Champions League.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> The late 2000s and early 2010s. They won the UEFA Cup in 2009 and had a strong Brazilian contingent that made them a force in Europe.
•   <strong>Zenit St. Petersburg:</strong> Mid 2000s to early 2010s. They won the UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2008 and were a major power in Russian football.
•   <strong>Rangers:</strong> Their greatest era was likely the 90s, winning nine league titles in a row. There was also the earlier dominance in the 20s and 30s.

That's the straight, unfiltered version. No sugarcoating.</div>
