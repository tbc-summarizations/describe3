  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this JPEGMAFIA business straight, Flo Rida style! Here's how I'm rankin' these albums, straight up:

•   <strong>Communist Slow Jams:</strong> 2/10. Sounds like somethin' that needs to be sped up. Not a fan.

•   <strong>Darkskin Manson:</strong> 5/10. Got a little bit of heat, but needs more sunshine.

•   <strong>The 2nd Amendment:</strong> 3/10. Doesn't hit as hard as my diamonds, next.

•   <strong>Black Ben Carson:</strong> 6/10. Now we're talkin'. Still not reachin' for the stars, but has somethin'.

•   <strong>The Wolf Returns:</strong> 4/10. Gotta be bigger, bolder. Let's put some bass on it.

•   <strong>EP II:</strong> 4/10. Like a mixtape, needs more tracks.

•   <strong>All My Heroes Are Cornballs:</strong> 9/10. This one's got that <em>boom boom pow</em>. Different, but I like it.

•   <strong>EP!:</strong> 5/10. Could be better with some remixes.

•   <strong>EP2!:</strong> 5/10. Still lookin' for that <em>low low low low low low low</em>.

•   <strong>LP!:</strong> 7/10. Get on my level. Some bangers on this one.

•   <strong>LP! (Offline Version):</strong> 6/10. Still bangin', but gotta have that internet connection.

•   <strong>OFFLINE!:</strong> 4/10. Disconnected. Needs a tune-up.

•   <strong>SCARING THE HOES:</strong> 8/10. Makin' some noise. This is worth some spins.

•   <strong>SCARING THE HOES: DLC PACK:</strong> 6/10. Could use more content but it's good regardless.

•   <strong>I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU:</strong> 7/10. This shits good I like it.

•   <strong>I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU (DIRECTOR'S CUT):</strong> 6/10. Still good though.

•   <strong>We Live In A Society:</strong> 4/10. What's this? I don't know what this.

•   <strong>Veteran: Director's Cut:</strong> 7/10. Better than nothing.</div>
