  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest prediction of Manchester City's Champions League group stage scorelines. I'm not pulling any punches here:

<strong>Home Matches:</strong>

•   <strong>Manchester City vs. Borussia Dortmund:</strong> 4-1. Dortmund is a shell of its former self and City will punish them ruthlessly. Haaland will bag a brace against his old club.
•   <strong>Manchester City vs. Bayer Leverkusen:</strong> 5-0. Leverkusen's defense is a joke. City will treat them like a training exercise, with multiple players getting on the scoresheet.
•   <strong>Manchester City vs. Napoli:</strong> 3-1. Napoli will put up a fight, they are a decent team but they are nothing compared to City and City will outclass them and win the game.
•   <strong>Manchester City vs. Galatasaray:</strong> 6-0. Galatasaray won't stand a chance. City will dominate possession and score at will against a team that can barely defend.

<strong>Away Matches:</strong>

•   <strong>Real Madrid vs. Manchester City:</strong> 1-2. This will be a tight game but City will eventually edge the win in a hard-fought match against a fading Real Madrid side that relies on individual moments of magic rather than sustained quality.
•   <strong>Villarreal vs. Manchester City:</strong> 0-3. Villarreal will try to sit back and defend but City's quality will be too much. An easy win for the Sky Blues.
•   <strong>Bodø/Glimt vs. Manchester City:</strong> 0-5. City will treat this game as a glorified training exercise against a club with not enough quality to match them.
•   <strong>Monaco vs. Manchester City:</strong> 1-3. Monaco will offer some resistance, but they are simply outmatched. City will cruise to victory.</div>
