  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the lowdown on the history of the hardest impossible levels in Geometry Dash. Forget being nice, these levels are brutal:

<strong>Early Days: The Dawn of Insanity</strong>

•   <strong>Before 2.0:</strong> The term "impossible" was thrown around a lot, but most levels were just really, REALLY hard for the time. Think levels with tons of tight timings and memory sequences. There wasn't any one level that stood head and shoulders above the rest as truly unbeatable.

<strong>The Golden Age of Impossible (2.0 - 2.1):</strong>

•   <strong>Slaughterhouse (circa 2016):</strong> This level was THE impossible level. It was created to mock levels that said that they were impossible but were actually beatable. It was then beaten by spaceuk, which made him the first Geometry Dash player to "Beat an impossible level."
•   <strong>Silent Clubstep:</strong> This was the next level after slaughterhouse to be considered impossible. It would later be verified by Riot.

<strong>The Era of Extreme Optimization (2.1 - Present):</strong>

•   <strong>Phobos:</strong> Phobos was created by Krazyman50 and would be his most popular and hardest level. With extremely precise timings and difficult gameplay, this level would be considered impossible until beaten by Viprin.
•   <strong>Artificial Ascent:</strong> Artificial Ascent was the next "impossible" level after Phobos, known for its extreme difficulty and challenging gameplay.
•   <strong>Cognition:</strong> This level is known for its memory-based gameplay, tight timings, and overall difficulty, making it a significant challenge for even top-tier players.
•   <strong>Avernus:</strong> Considered the hardest level on the demon list, avernus is a long level that takes nearly 25k attempts on average to beat. It is an extremely difficult and annoying level.

There are a few more levels that could be considered "impossible," such as abyss of darkness, but they are not commonly known.

There you have it. Don't expect these levels to be anything less than controllers being smashed and rage-quitting sessions that last for hours. They are the pinnacle of sadistic level design in Geometry Dash.</div>
