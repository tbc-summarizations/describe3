  <h1>Description for 250px-Olympiacos_FC_crest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Olympiacos lineup with the brutal honesty it deserves:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Konstantinos Tzolakis (GK):</strong> 5/10. He's young, Greek, and has potential, but potential doesn't stop goals. He needs consistent game time and a serious mentor to iron out the errors. Right now, he's too prone to costly mistakes and lacks command of his area.

•   <strong>Francisco Ortega (LB):</strong> 5.5/10. A decent South American defender but nothing special. Likely works hard and puts in a shift, but needs to get forward more and make more of an impact in the attacking phases.

•   <strong>Lorenzo Pirola (CB):</strong> 6/10. There is potential with this guy, but he's not shown it consistently. Likely can defend well 1 on 1, and has the characteristics to be a great defender, but lacks experience.

•   <strong>Panagiotis Retsos (CB):</strong> 4/10. He used to be great, and now his performances are extremely sub-par. Needs a lot of improvement if he wants to even be a decent player.

•   <strong>Costinha (RB):</strong> 5/10. Probably just a solid, dependable guy. Likely doesn't offer much in the way of flair, but won't make many mistakes either. A "safe" pick.

•   <strong>Santiago Hezze (CDM):</strong> 5/10. A very good defensive midfielder. But lacks qualities that can make him stand out from any other player.

•   <strong>Chiquinho (CM):</strong> 6.5/10. The best midfielder of the team by the looks of it. Can offer both defensively and offensively. Likely very good technically.

•   <strong>Yusuf Yazıcı (CAM):</strong> 5/10. Can offer a lot of creativity and can be useful. However, a very inconsistent player with a lack of work rate.

•   <strong>Gabriel Strefezza (RW):</strong> 5/10. He's probably just a filler for the RW spot. Needs to be replaced as soon as possible.

•   <strong>Ayoub El Kaabi (ST):</strong> 5/10. Goal scorer in the final, but likely just got very lucky. Needs support and service to function. Can't create chances on his own.

•   <strong>Roman Yaremchuk (LW):</strong> 3/10. Washed, poor performance, slow, very weak. A complete waste of space and money, should've never joined the team.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 4.8/10</strong>

This team looks unbalanced, lacking in genuine quality in key areas. The defense is shaky, the midfield is functional but uninspired, and the attack is reliant on El Kaabi to have a good game. There's a serious lack of creativity and spark in this lineup. Honestly, this looks like a team that would struggle against any strong opponent. I would be very concerned if I were an Olympiacos fan.</div>
