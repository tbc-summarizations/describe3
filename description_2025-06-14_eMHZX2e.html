  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercup, because this ain't your grandma's soccer match. We're talking France vs. Evil France, and the gloves are OFF.

<strong>Opening Scene:</strong>

The stadium is packed, flags are waving (French flags, but also flags with upside-down fleur-de-lis for the Evil France side). The tension is thicker than a Parisian fog. The ref blows the whistle, and immediately chaos erupts.

•   <strong>Minute 1:</strong> Mbappé streaks down the field, but Evil Mbappé (wearing a sinister goatee and a sneer) slides in with a tackle that's less "slide" and more "attempted leg removal." The crowd roars. Yellow card for Evil Mbappé.
•   <strong>Minute 5:</strong> GOAL! Griezmann curls one in from outside the box. BOOM! Fireworks explode, the French anthem blares, and Evil France looks rattled.
•   <strong>Minute 10:</strong> Evil France retaliates. Evil Giroud elbows a French defender in the face while the ref isn't looking. Grunts of pain, followed by a suspiciously loud CRACK. No call! The French fans are livid.

<strong>Things Escalate:</strong>

This is where things get INTERESTING. Forget fair play, we're talking about EVIL.

•   <strong>Minute 20:</strong> A sniper in the Evil France stands takes aim. BANG! A French midfielder goes down. Is it foul play? Is it...attempted assassination? The commentators are losing their minds.
•   <strong>Minute 30:</strong> A tank rolls onto the field, driven by Evil Pogba. It starts firing soccer balls at the French goal with the force of cannonballs. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
•   <strong>Minute 40:</strong> The French respond in kind. Zidane appears on the sidelines, looking less like a retired legend and more like a vengeful general. He pulls out a bazooka and takes aim at the Evil France bench. WHOOSH! KA-BLAMMO!

<strong>Halftime Madness:</strong>

The score is 2-1 in favor of France, but the body count is rising. Halftime entertainment? Forget the marching band, we've got gladiatorial combat between the mascots. One mascot is eaten by a lion. It's brutal.

<strong>Second Half Mayhem:</strong>

•   <strong>Minute 50:</strong> Evil Mbappé pulls out a machine gun and starts mowing down the French defense. RAT-A-TAT-TAT! Bodies hit the turf. The ref just shrugs. "Play on!"
•   <strong>Minute 60:</strong> A giant robot, piloted by Evil Kanté, stomps onto the field. It begins crushing the French players under its metallic feet. CRUNCH!
•   <strong>Minute 70:</strong> Nuclear strike by Evil France! France fights back, it is a nuclear war.

<strong>The Grand Finale:</strong>

•   <strong>Minute 89:</strong> With the stadium in ruins and the field a smoldering wasteland, only Mbappé and Evil Mbappé remain. They face off in a final showdown, a battle of wills, skill, and sheer, unadulterated evil.
•   <strong>Minute 90+:</strong> Mbappé unleashes a final shot, a laser beam of pure footballing prowess. It pierces Evil Mbappé's heart. He crumples to the ground. FRANCE WINS!

The surviving French fans go wild. The French anthem is sung, accompanied by the sounds of explosions and gunfire. France has defeated Evil France, but at what cost?

<strong>The Aftermath:</strong>

The world is changed. Football will never be the same. And somewhere, a tiny, evil voice whispers, "We'll be back..."</div>
