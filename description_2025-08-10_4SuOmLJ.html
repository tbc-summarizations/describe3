  <h1>Description for 114.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Beşiktaş squad for the 2025/26 season with maximum honesty:

<strong>Manager:</strong>

•   <strong>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:</strong> 4/10. He's proven himself to be tactically inept at a high level, and his success at Molde and the initial honeymoon period at United were flukes. He seems out of his depth managing anything but a mid-table side.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ersin Destanoğlu:</strong> 6/10. He's decent, but not a world-beater. Prone to errors.
•   <strong>Mert Günok:</strong> 5/10. Likely past his prime by 2025/26 and a backup at best.
•   <strong>Emre Bilgin & Emir Yaşar:</strong> 3/10. Probably not good enough for a top-tier team.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Felix Uduokhai:</strong> 6/10. Average defender.
•   <strong>Emirhan Topçu:</strong> 5/10. May develop but is average now.
•   <strong>Tayyip Talha Sanuç:</strong> 5/10. Nothing special.
•   <strong>Gabriel Paulista:</strong> 4/10. Way too old and past it by 2025/26.
•   <strong>Emrecan Uzunhan:</strong> 4/10. Probably not good enough.
•   <strong>Necip Uysal:</strong> 2/10. Club legend, but should be nowhere near the first team.
•   <strong>David Jurasek:</strong> 5/10. Unremarkable.
•   <strong>Emrecan Terzi:</strong> 4/10. Not good enough.
•   <strong>Jonas Svensson:</strong> 4/10. Aging and nothing exceptional.
•   <strong>Arda Berk Özüarap:</strong> 3/10. Lacks quality.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Wilfred Ndidi:</strong> 7/10. A solid defensive midfielder, but nothing more.
•   <strong>Moatasem Al-Musrati:</strong> 6/10. Average midfielder.
•   <strong>Demir Ege Tiknaz:</strong> 4/10. Not ready for the first team.
•   <strong>Amir Hadziahmetovic:</strong> 6/10. Mediocre player.
•   <strong>Kartal Yilmaz:</strong> 4/10. Average.
•   <strong>Jean Onana:</strong> 3/10. Not good enough.
•   <strong>Orkun Kökçü:</strong> 8/10. The one bright spark in this midfield. Quality player.
•   <strong>Elan Ricardo:</strong> 3/10. Insignificant.
•   <strong>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain:</strong> 3/10. Injury-prone and past his best.
•   <strong>Salih Uçan:</strong> 4/10. Average.
•   <strong>Tayfur Bingöl:</strong> 4/10. Utility player at best.
•   <strong>Fahri Ay:</strong> 2/10. Not good enough.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ernest Muci:</strong> 7/10. Decent potential, but inconsistent.
•   <strong>Joao Mario:</strong> 5/10. Overrated.
•   <strong>Keny Arroyo:</strong> 5/10. Lacks quality.
•   <strong>Milot Rashica:</strong> 6/10. Inconsistent winger.
•   <strong>Can Keleş:</strong> 4/10. Won't reach the top level.
•   <strong>Rafa Silva:</strong> 6/10. Aging and a declining force.
•   <strong>Tammy Abraham:</strong> 7/10. Decent player.
•   <strong>Mustafa Hekimoğlu:</strong> 3/10. Inconsequential.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>4.5/10</strong>

This squad is a mess. Too many aging players past their prime, a serious lack of quality in key positions, and a manager who is demonstrably incapable of taking them to the next level. Orkun Kökçü and Wilfred Ndidi are the only players that I would consider to be quality signings and will be good enough to play in a top-tier team. This team is destined for mid-table mediocrity at best. With Solskjaer at the helm, I'd honestly expect a relegation battle.</div>
