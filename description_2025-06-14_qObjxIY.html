  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest and detailed lineup of the best XI I can assemble from players of England, Italy, Ukraine, North Macedonia, and Malta, based on current form and quality:

<strong>Formation: 4-3-3</strong>

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Gianluigi Donnarumma (Italy):</strong> There isn't even a contest here. Donnarumma is a world-class goalkeeper, far above any other options in the other national teams. His shot-stopping ability and command in the box are unquestionable.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Back: Kyle Walker (England):</strong> His pace and defensive solidity are top-tier, even if he isn't the most creative going forward. He's still the best RB available.
•   <strong>Center Back: John Stones (England):</strong> When on form, Stones is a ball-playing center back with excellent composure and passing range. His ability to step out from the back is vital.
•   <strong>Center Back: Alessandro Bastoni (Italy):</strong> A rising star, Bastoni offers a great mix of physicality and technical ability. He's solid in the tackle and comfortable with the ball at his feet.
•   <strong>Left Back: Oleksandr Zinchenko (Ukraine):</strong> Zinchenko brings a lot of experience and is a solid performer.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Midfielder: Declan Rice (England):</strong> Rice is a beast. He's a defensive anchor, shielding the back four and winning back possession with incredible consistency.
•   <strong>Central Midfielder: Nicolo Barella (Italy):</strong> Barella is a dynamic, box-to-box midfielder. He's energetic, has a good eye for a pass, and is a goal threat.
•   <strong>Central Midfielder: Jude Bellingham (England):</strong> Bellingham is a phenom. His athleticism, technique, and football IQ are off the charts. He can do it all – tackle, dribble, pass, and score.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>Right Winger: Bukayo Saka (England):</strong> Saka is electric. His dribbling skills are exceptional, and he has a knack for scoring crucial goals.
•   <strong>Center Forward: Harry Kane (England):</strong> Kane is a goal machine. He's a clinical finisher, a great passer, and has excellent awareness in the box. No other striker from the other nations even comes close.
•   <strong>Left Winger: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Georgia playing for Napoli):</strong> This guy is a sensation. He can do everything and is an amazing prospect.

<strong>Why this lineup?</strong>

•   <strong>Dominated by England and Italy:</strong> Let's be honest, the talent pool of the other nations is simply not comparable. England and Italy provide the core of this team.
•   <strong>Balance:</strong> This lineup blends defensive solidity with attacking flair. The midfield is hard-working and creative, while the forwards are lethal.
•   <strong>Experience and Youth:</strong> There's a good mix of experienced players and young talents who are hungry to prove themselves.

<strong>Harsh Truths:</strong>

•   <strong>Limited contributions from North Macedonia and Malta:</strong> No players from these nations make the cut. The gap in quality is simply too wide.
•   <strong>Defensive Vulnerabilities:</strong> While the defense is solid, it's not impenetrable. There could be communication issues between players from different leagues and national teams.
•   <strong>Midfield Creativity:</strong> While Barella and Bellingham are creative, this team relies heavily on individual brilliance in the final third. More structured attacking patterns might be needed.

This lineup is brutally honest and based on current form and ability. If you want a team that is capable of going all the way in a major tournament, this is it.</div>
