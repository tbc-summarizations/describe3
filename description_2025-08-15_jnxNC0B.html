  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these Champions League qualifying results:

<strong>Champions Path:</strong>

•   <strong>Malmö:</strong> Embarrassing. 0-5? Did they even bother showing up? Back to the Swedish league, boys, where you belong.
•   <strong>Kairat:</strong> They barely squeezed through against Slovan Bratislava via Penalties but you can only feel pity for them.
•   <strong>Lech Poznań:</strong> 2-4 loss to Red Star Belgrade? They need to invest in some actual defenders if they want to compete on the European stage.
•   <strong>Ludogorets:</strong> Outclassed by Ferencváros. Their European aspirations are going up in smoke.
•   <strong>Dynamo Kyiv:</strong> Humiliated by Pafos. 0-3 at home? They can dream on to even qualify for the tournament.
•   <strong>Shkëndija:</strong> Completely obliterated by Qarabağ. A 1-6 aggregate score shows a massive gulf in quality.

<strong>League Path:</strong>

•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg:</strong> Shocking collapse against Club Brugge. Maybe they should stick to sponsoring energy drinks, because their football team is running out of juice.
•   <strong>Rangers:</strong> Dominated Viktoria Plzeň. 4-2 aggregate. They still need to improve to be considered a top team.
•   <strong>Nice:</strong> Annihilated by Benfica. 0-4 on aggregate at home? The home fans are throwing garbage into their own pitch and booing them relentlessly.
•   <strong>Feyenoord:</strong> Pathetic performance, crumbling in the face of Fenerbahçe. Clearly, their defense needs a complete overhaul. Enjoy the Europa League, losers.</div>
