  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of each team's chances of qualifying for the UEFA Europa League:

â€¢   <strong>Hapoel Be'er Sheva ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±:</strong> 65%. They've been a consistent force in Israeli football and have some experience in European competitions. Their biggest hurdle will be navigating the qualifying rounds against tougher opponents, but they have the potential to make it.
â€¢   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦:</strong> 90%. Despite the ongoing challenges in Ukraine, Shakhtar remains a strong team with a solid infrastructure. Their European pedigree and financial resources give them a significant advantage.
â€¢   <strong>Partizan ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸:</strong> 70%. Partizan is a historically strong club with a passionate fanbase. Serbian teams can be unpredictable in Europe, but Partizan has a good chance of making it through the qualifiers.
â€¢   <strong>Legia Warsaw ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±:</strong> 60%. Legia has a decent chance. They are one of the top clubs in Poland, but their European campaigns have often been disappointing. They need to show more consistency to qualify.
â€¢   <strong>AEK Larnaca ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¾:</strong> 50%. AEK Larnaca has been a regular participant in European competitions in recent years. They have a chance, but will need to play exceptionally well to overcome tougher opponents.
â€¢   <strong>Paks ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º:</strong> 20%. As a smaller club in Hungary, Paks faces a tough challenge. They lack the experience and resources of the bigger teams, making their chances slim.
â€¢   <strong>HÃ¤cken ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª:</strong> 45%. HÃ¤cken is a decent team from Sweden, but they might struggle against more established European clubs.
â€¢   <strong>CFR Cluj ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´:</strong> 55%. CFR Cluj is a decent team with some experience in Europe.
â€¢   <strong>Levski Sofia ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬:</strong> 30%. Levski Sofia has a rich history, but they have struggled in recent years. Bulgarian teams often face financial difficulties, which impacts their performance. Their chances are relatively low.
â€¢   <strong>Sabah ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿:</strong> 35%. Sabah is a relatively new club in Azerbaijan and lacks significant European experience. They will need to pull off some upsets to qualify.
â€¢   <strong>Spartak Trnava ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°:</strong> 40%. They are a decent team with some upset potential, but it's still pretty low.
â€¢   <strong>Celje ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡®:</strong> 25%. Celje is a smaller club from Slovenia with limited European experience. Their chances of qualifying are low.
â€¢   <strong>Sheriff Tiraspol ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡©:</strong> 80%. Sheriff has proven they can compete at a high level in Europe. They have a good infrastructure and a knack for causing upsets. Their chances are quite high.
â€¢   <strong>Prishtina ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡°:</strong> 10%. Prishtina is a relatively unknown club from Kosovo. They lack the experience and resources to compete effectively in the Europa League qualifiers.
â€¢   <strong>Aktobe ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿:</strong> 15%. Aktobe is a club from Kazakhstan. Like other clubs from the region, they face logistical challenges and lack the resources of top European teams.
â€¢   <strong>Ilves ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®:</strong> 5%. Ilves is a small club from Finland and lacks the resources and experience to be anything in European competitions.</div>
