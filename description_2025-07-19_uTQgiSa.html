  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on these transfers, rated out of 10, with no sugarcoating:

<strong>Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool):</strong> 10/10. This is a game-changer. Wirtz is a generational talent, and Liverpool is getting him at what is potentially the perfect time. He would give Klopp a world-class creative midfielder, he's got the potential to become a club legend at Anfield. This is a statement signing.

<strong>Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United):</strong> 4/10. What are they thinking? Cunha has flashes of brilliance, but is inconsistent and lacks the killer instinct United desperately needs. He's not the answer to their goalscoring problems, and this feels like a panic buy. Erik Ten Hag would have been better off developing a young player.

<strong>Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal):</strong> 7/10. A solid, if unspectacular, addition. Zubimendi is a reliable defensive midfielder who will provide stability to Arsenal's midfield. He's not a world-beater, but he's a significant upgrade over what they currently have in that position. Arteta needs a better holding midfielder and Zubimendi fits the system.

<strong>Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea):</strong> 2/10. Another "project" player for Chelsea? Gittens has shown flashes of talent, but he's far from the finished product. Chelsea already has a squad full of unproven youngsters, and this just adds to the chaos. He'll spend half of his time injured and the other half rotting on the bench. A waste of money.

<strong>Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham):</strong> 8/10. Excellent business for Spurs. Kudus is a dynamic, versatile attacker who will thrive under Postecoglou's attacking style. He adds pace, creativity, and goals to the team. This would be a brilliant deal.

<strong>Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea):</strong> 4/10. I don't get it. He's shown promise at Brighton, but is he really the answer to Chelsea's striker issues? He's inconsistent and lacks the physicality to lead the line in the Premier League. Another overpriced gamble for Chelsea.

<strong>Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid):</strong> 6/10. Smart move for Real Madrid to invest in a young center back with potential. Huijsen has shown promise on loan at Roma and could develop into a quality player in the future, but will likely remain a bench warmer to start.

<strong>Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle):</strong> 5/10. Meh. Elanga is a decent winger, but he's not going to set the world on fire. He'll provide squad depth for Newcastle, but he's not the kind of signing that will get fans excited. Very mid.

<strong>Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal):</strong> 1/10. I am highly doubtful. Is he that good to be playing for arsenal? I don't see it. He will not get any minutes, but might as well play for a better team.

<strong>Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City):</strong> 7/10. A sneaky good signing for City. Reijnders is a technically gifted midfielder who will add quality and depth to their squad. He's not a superstar, but he's a reliable player who will contribute to City's dominance.

<strong>Alvaro Carreras (Benfica to Real Madrid):</strong> 3/10. Carreras does not have what it takes. I don't see why they got this player.

<strong>Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth to Liverpool):</strong> 7/10. A promising left-back with plenty of potential. He's strong defensively and has a good engine, making him a good fit for Klopp's high-energy style. An upgrade on Liverpool's current options.

<strong>Franco Mastantuono (River Plate to Real Madrid):</strong> 8/10. Real Madrid is building for the future. Mastantuono is a highly-rated teenager with bags of potential, and Real Madrid is smart to snap him up early. He's not ready for the first team yet, but he could be a superstar in the making.

<strong>Alex Baena (Villarreal to Atletico Madrid):</strong> 8/10. A fantastic signing for Atletico. Baena is a creative midfielder with a great eye for goal. He'll add flair and dynamism to Atletico's attack, and he's a perfect fit for Simeone's system.

<strong>Jeremie Frimpong (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool):</strong> 9/10. What a signing! Frimpong is an explosive attacking full-back with incredible pace and energy. He's a nightmare for defenders and will add a new dimension to Liverpool's attack. Top class.

<strong>Jean-Clair Todibo (Nice to West Ham):</strong> 6/10. A decent signing for West Ham. Todibo is a solid center-back with good technical ability. He'll add some much-needed quality to their defense.

<strong>Rayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves to Manchester City):</strong> 2/10. This transfer makes no sense. Ait-Nouri has been so bad recently and City needs quality players. This makes zero sense.

<strong>Rayan Cherki (Lyon to Manchester City):</strong> 1/10. Similar to Ait-Nouri. Cherki is massively overrated. I don't get why he's so hyped up. I can't believe Pep would even consider this.

<strong>Liam Delap (Ipswich Town to Chelsea):</strong> 4/10. What are they doing? He's never good.

<strong>Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven to Bayer Leverkusen):</strong> 5/10. He will get no play time on leverkusen. What a terrible decision.

There you have it, brutally honest.</div>
