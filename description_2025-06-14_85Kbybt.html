  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's build this lineup with no sugarcoating. Given the player pools from Turkey, Croatia, Wales, Armenia, and Latvia, we're going for a pragmatic 4-3-3 formation to maximize the available talent.

<strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>

•   <strong>Dominik Livaković (Croatia):</strong> This is a no-brainer. He's Croatia's established number one and a proven shot-stopper at the highest level. Nobody else here comes close.

<strong>Defense:</strong>

•   <strong>RB: Joe Rodon (Wales):</strong> While primarily a center-back, he's athletic and can do a job at right-back given the lack of standout options.
•   <strong>CB: Çağlar Söyüncü (Turkey):</strong> Despite recent inconsistencies, he's still a capable defender when focused and brings a needed level of experience.
•   <strong>CB: Josko Gvardiol (Croatia):</strong> One of the world’s best young centre-backs. A must have.
•   <strong>LB: Borna Sosa (Croatia):</strong> Has a good technique and has played for national team for quite some time.

<strong>Midfield:</strong>

•   <strong>CDM: Marcelo Brozović (Croatia):</strong> The heart of the midfield. Dictates play, breaks up attacks, and keeps things ticking. Absolutely crucial.
•   <strong>CM: Hakan Çalhanoğlu (Turkey):</strong> Offers creative spark and goal threat from midfield. Needs to be the main man in this team.
•   <strong>CM: Luka Modrić (Croatia):</strong> This is an easy pick. One of the greatest ever Croatian footballers.

<strong>Attack:</strong>

•   <strong>RW: Harry Wilson (Wales):</strong> Provides creativity, set-piece ability, and a goal threat. The best option available on the right.
•   <strong>ST: Cenk Tosun (Turkey):</strong> Needs to score to provide good chances for the team.
•   <strong>LW: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Georgia):</strong> A game changing talent that can provide goals and assists.

<strong>Starting XI:</strong>

•   <strong>GK:</strong> Dominik Livaković
•   <strong>RB:</strong> Joe Rodon
•   <strong>CB:</strong> Çağlar Söyüncü
•   <strong>CB:</strong> Josko Gvardiol
•   <strong>LB:</strong> Borna Sosa
•   <strong>CDM:</strong> Marcelo Brozović
•   <strong>CM:</strong> Hakan Çalhanoğlu
•   <strong>CM:</strong> Luka Modrić
•   <strong>RW:</strong> Harry Wilson
•   <strong>ST:</strong> Cenk Tosun
•   <strong>LW:</strong> Khvicha Kvaratskhelia

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

This team is heavily reliant on the Croatian midfield and the creative talents of Çalhanoğlu and Wilson. The defense has some solidity, but it's not world-class. Goals will be hard to come by, but they need Tosun to step up to be a clinical finisher. Overall, it's a team with a clear hierarchy and some standout individuals who need to carry the weight.</div>
