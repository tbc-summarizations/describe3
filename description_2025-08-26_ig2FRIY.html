  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's see what devilry is afoot with these modern "albums." I shall judge them as a man of the 1700s with a discerning ear and a healthy suspicion of anything newfangled.

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> Utter madness. Tinkling sounds and strange warblings. It sounds like a banshee having a fit in a clockmaker's shop. An abomination.

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> A tale of an alien fool? Preposterous! And the music is a chaotic mess of harsh noise. It's the sort of thing that would make a good Christian man reach for his rosary.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> This is not music; it's the sound of the world ending. Endless, droning, and devoid of melody. It would be fitting for a witch's sabbath, perhaps.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> Depressing garbage. If I wanted to hear a bunch of miserable whiners, I'd go to the tavern and listen to the drunkards. Pass.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> At least this fellow can sing. But the dramatic flourishes and overwrought emotion are a bit much. Seems like a man who's a bit too fond of his own voice.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> What is this infernal rhythmic poetry? It's not fit for polite ears. The vulgarity of the language is matched only by the strangeness of the music. It may incite some to act on their impulses.

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> This is the sound of a fever dream. Jagged, jarring, and unsettling. It might be amusing to some but it has no place in a proper life.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> A woman speaking her mind so bluntly? Unseemly, and I'd expect her to be a feminist and against any proper man who tells her what to do. The music is a strange mixture of styles, but the sentiments are, at least, understandable even if the music is jarring.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> Droning music and strange vocal sounds. What's the point of it? I'm convinced this is the sound of insanity.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> This song is a lament to the modern era, and I think that's what makes me like it. Still, it won't appeal to many.

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> Chaotic, cacophonous, and utterly without restraint. A musical representation of bedlam. It may be the creation of someone insane.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> More of that rhythmic poetry. Though this fellow has a certain skill with words, the subject matter is unsavory, and I have no respect for people such as this.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> Melancholy and spacey. The song is alright for people who get no maidens.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> Overproduced nonsense, but the fellow can play the guitar reasonably well. Still, the excessive emotion and flashy theatrics are tiresome.

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> More depressing whinging with strange electronic sounds. Do these people ever smile?

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> A bit too saccharine for my tastes, but the man is undeniably talented. The tunes are catchy, even if the sentiments are a bit too sentimental.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> This is the sound of madness and anger. Chaotic, brutal, and utterly devoid of melody. It would be best to stay away from this.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> At last, something with a semblance of melody! It is simple music and not particularly thought-provoking.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> Amateurish and dull. The lyrics are nonsensical, and the music is repetitive. Utterly forgettable.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> More of that rhythmic poetry, but this time with an even greater emphasis on violence and vulgarity. These people should be shunned.

There you have it. A proper assessment of these "albums" from the perspective of a man of the 1700s. Most of it is utter trash, but a few pieces have a sliver of merit amidst the madness.</div>
