  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are 5 removals and who should take them, based on what I see in the map:

1.  <strong>Remove:</strong> "Azawad" (Northern Mali). <strong>Annexed by:</strong> Mali. This whole "revolt" looks like a pathetic land grab by a bunch of desert bandits. Mali should stomp them into the sand and reassert control.

2.  <strong>Remove:</strong> "Tripolitania". <strong>Annexed by:</strong> Libya. Libya just needs to get its act together and deal with the terrorists.

3.  <strong>Remove:</strong> "Donetsk/Luhansk People's Republics". <strong>Annexed by:</strong> Russia. These puppet states are a joke. Annex them officially or stop pretending like you have nothing to do with it.

4.  <strong>Remove:</strong> "South Yemen". <strong>Annexed by:</strong> Yemen. Yemen will get it together eventually and South Yemen should rejoin the country and stop with the infighting.

5.  <strong>Remove:</strong> "Eastern Ukraine". <strong>Annexed by:</strong> Russia. Annex them officially or stop pretending like you have nothing to do with it.</div>
