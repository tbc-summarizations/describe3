  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this team with the cold, hard truth. This isn't about being nice; it's about brutal honesty and a realistic assessment.

<strong>Individual Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Alisson Becker:</strong> 8.5. Excellent shot-stopper, great distribution for a keeper, commands his area well. A top-tier keeper in his prime.
•   <strong>João Cancelo:</strong> 8.5. Technically gifted, great passer, can play on both flanks, adds a lot going forward. His defensive awareness is decent.
•   <strong>Fabio Cannavaro:</strong> 9.5. One of the best defenders ever. Impeccable positioning, relentless, and a born leader. His ability to read the game is unmatched.
•   <strong>Virgil van Dijk:</strong> 9.5. Dominant in the air, physically imposing, great passer, and excellent at organizing the defense. His presence alone makes a massive difference.
•   <strong>Achraf Hakimi:</strong> 8.5. Lightning-fast, incredible stamina, and adds so much in attack. His defensive positioning can be a liability at times, but his speed can help recover.
•   <strong>Mohamed Salah:</strong> 9.5. A goal-scoring machine, skillful dribbler, and a nightmare for defenders. His work rate is underrated, and he’s always a threat.
•   <strong>Pavel Nedvěd:</strong> 9. An absolute workhorse, incredible stamina, and a ferocious competitor. His technical skill is world-class, and he's always driving the team forward.
•   <strong>Luka Modrić:</strong> 9.5. Visionary passer, excellent dribbler, and a master of controlling the tempo of the game. His ability to dictate play is unparalleled.
•   <strong>Lionel Messi:</strong> 10. Need I say more? The greatest dribbler of all time, an incredible scorer, and a genius playmaker. The complete package.
•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong> 10. Relentless goal-scorer, physically imposing, and a master of getting into goal-scoring positions. His determination and drive are unmatched.
•   <strong>Pelé:</strong> 10. Explosive, skillful, and a natural goal-scorer. His all-around game was decades ahead of his time.

<strong>Team Rating: 9.7/10</strong>

<strong>Strengths:</strong>

•   <strong>Unmatched Attacking Prowess:</strong> Messi, Ronaldo, Pelé, and Salah in their prime? It's an absolute goal-scoring machine. Defenses would be terrified.
•   <strong>Defensive Solidity:</strong> Cannavaro and Van Dijk is an almost impenetrable wall. They have the positioning, physicality, and leadership to shut down almost any attack.
•   <strong>Creative Midfield:</strong> Modrić and Nedvěd provide a perfect blend of creativity, work rate, and tactical intelligence. They can control the game, create chances, and break up opposition attacks.
•   <strong>Full-Back Firepower:</strong> Cancelo and Hakimi provide width, pace, and attacking threat. Their ability to get forward and deliver quality crosses adds another dimension to the attack.
•   <strong>Goalkeeping Assurance:</strong> Alisson is a reliable and high-quality keeper who can make crucial saves when needed.

<strong>Weaknesses:</strong>

•   <strong>Defensive Liability due to Hakimi + Cancelo</strong>: While their attacking is world class. Their defensive ability is sometimes concerning.
•   <strong>Tactical Flexibility:</strong> A 4-4-2 can be rigid. This team would need a manager who can adapt and change the system when needed.
•   <strong>Age:</strong> This is a hypothetical team of players in their prime, but in reality, age can be a factor. Keeping everyone fit and at their peak simultaneously would be a challenge.

<strong>Champions League Performance:</strong>

This team would be the absolute favorites to win the Champions League, and by a significant margin. I'm talking about a 95% chance of winning. Here's why:

•   <strong>Group Stage Domination:</strong> They would likely win every game in the group stage. The sheer quality of the attack would overwhelm any defense they face.
•   <strong>Knockout Stage Dominance:</strong> They could beat almost any team. Their defense is too good, and their attack is unstoppable.
•   <strong>Final Victory:</strong> They would likely win the final comfortably. They have the experience, the quality, and the mental strength to perform under pressure.

<strong>Brutally Honest Conclusion:</strong>

This team is almost unbeatable on paper. They have the perfect blend of attacking firepower, defensive solidity, and midfield creativity. They would dominate any competition they enter, and they would likely win the Champions League with ease. Their biggest challenge would be keeping everyone fit and managing the egos of so many superstars. However, with the right manager, this team would be a force to be reckoned with. It’s a dream team designed to win, and it would do just that.</div>
