  <h1>Description for 19.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Belgium squad and get brutally honest. I'm not holding back.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid):</strong> 9.5/10 - When fit, he's easily one of the best in the world. Dominating presence, incredible shot-stopping, and commands his area. His injury proneness is a major concern, though.

•   <strong>Mike Penders (Strasbourg):</strong> 5/10 - Solid backup, nothing spectacular. Decent reflexes but lacks the experience and overall quality of a top-tier keeper.

•   <strong>Maarten Vandevoordt (RB Leipzig):</strong> 6.5/10 - Promising talent, but still raw. Needs consistent playing time to develop fully. Potential is there, but potential doesn't win games now.

•   <strong>Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest):</strong> 6/10 - A decent shot-stopper, but prone to errors. Not a top-level keeper, more of a journeyman.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Zeno Debast (Sporting CP):</strong> 6.5/10 - Decent, young, and shows promise. Needs to develop physically to handle the rigors of international football.

•   <strong>Arthur Theate (Eintracht Frankfurt):</strong> 7/10 - Solid defender. Reliable and consistent, but lacks the flair and dominance of a world-class center-back.

•   <strong>Koni De Winter (AC Milan):</strong> 6/10 - Young and promising. Needs more experience at the highest level. Decent potential.

•   <strong>Brandon Mechele (Club Brugge):</strong> 5/10 - Serviceable, but lacks pace and agility. Not good enough for a team with aspirations of winning anything significant.

•   <strong>Maxim De Cuyper (Brighton):</strong> 6/10 - Promising but unproven. Needs to show more consistency and defensive awareness.

•   <strong>Joaquin Seys (Club Brugge):</strong> 4/10 - Not good enough to be in the squad. Lacks the quality and experience needed at this level.

•   <strong>Timothy Castagne (Fulham):</strong> 7/10 - Versatile and hard-working. Can play on either flank. Not a world-beater, but a reliable squad player.

•   <strong>Thomas Meunier (Lille OSC):</strong> 6.5/10 - Past his prime. Lacks the pace and energy he once had. Still offers experience, but a liability defensively.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Charles Vanhoutte (Nice):</strong> 5/10 - Depth player. Nothing special.

•   <strong>Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa):</strong> 7.5/10 - Good passing range and technique, but can be inconsistent. Doesn't always dominate games as he should.

•   <strong>Nicolas Raskin (Rangers):</strong> 5.5/10 - Okay, but not a game-changer.

•   <strong>Diego Moreira (Strasbourg):</strong> 5.5/10 - Raw talent, but needs more refinement.

•   <strong>Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta):</strong> 7/10 - Talented but inconsistent. Needs to find his best position and play with more confidence.

•   <strong>Kevin De Bruyne (Napoli):</strong> 9/10 - World-class playmaker. Vision, passing, and shooting are exceptional. Injury concerns are a major issue.

•   <strong>Hans Vanaken (Club Brugge):</strong> 6/10 - Lacks the pace and athleticism to excel at the highest level.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Jeremy Doku (Manchester City):</strong> 8/10 - Exciting winger with blistering pace and dribbling skills. Needs to improve his decision-making and end product.

•   <strong>Malick Fofana (Lyon):</strong> 6/10 - Promising, but unproven at this level.

•   <strong>Leandro Trossard (Arsenal):</strong> 7.5/10 - Versatile and intelligent player. Good technique and work rate. Not a superstar, but a valuable squad member.

•   <strong>Alexis Saelemaekers (AC Milan):</strong> 6.5/10 - Decent pace and dribbling. Lacks consistency.

•   <strong>Lois Openda (Juventus):</strong> 8/10 - Pace and finishing ability. Can be wasteful in front of goal.

•   <strong>Michy Batshuayi (Eintracht Frankfurt):</strong> 6/10 - A shadow of his former self. Doesn't offer much.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 6.5/10</strong>

<strong>Brutal Summary:</strong>

This Belgium squad is a shadow of the team that was considered a golden generation. Too many players are past their prime or simply not good enough. The defense is shaky, the midfield lacks dynamism outside of De Bruyne, and the attack relies too heavily on individual brilliance. They lack a clear identity and leadership. Injury concerns surrounding key players like Courtois and De Bruyne only add to the problems. They might make it out of the group stages, but they won't be challenging for any major titles. A squad full of potential that never lived up to the hype. Now they're just old and not that good.</div>
