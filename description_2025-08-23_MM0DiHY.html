  <h1>Description for 418.png, 131.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest prediction for that El Clasico lineup:

<strong>Real Madrid 5 - 1 Barcelona</strong>

<strong>My reasoning:</strong>

•   <strong>Real Madrid's Attack is God-Tier:</strong> Seriously, you've put Mbappé, Vinicius, Rodrygo, and Bellingham on the same team? That's just unfair. Barcelona's defense, especially with young Cubarsí, will be torn to shreds. The pace and skill of those four will be impossible to contain.
•   <strong>Real Madrid Midfield Dominance:</strong> Valverde and Güler are a solid pairing. They might not be as flashy as Barcelona's midfield, but they'll win the physical battles, intercept passes, and allow Real's attacking talent to shine.
•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold is Crucial:</strong> In this hypothetical scenario, his pinpoint crosses to Mbappé and the others will be a constant threat. Barcelona won't have an answer for his attacking contributions.
•   <strong>Barcelona's Youth and Inexperience:</strong> García in goal, Cubarsí at the back, and Yamal upfront – that's a recipe for disaster against a team as experienced and ruthless as Real Madrid. They'll be overwhelmed by the occasion.
•   <strong>Rashford Is a Mismatch:</strong> Rashford is a great player in the right system but will be isolated upfront.

<strong>Goalscorers Prediction:</strong>

•   Mbappé (2)
•   Vinicius (1)
•   Bellingham (1)
•   Rodrygo (1)
•   Rashford (1)

<strong>In Summary:</strong> Barcelona will struggle massively here. Real Madrid have too much quality in attack and enough steel in midfield to dominate this game from start to finish.</div>
