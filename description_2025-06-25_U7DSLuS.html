  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the brutal roast of the events that happened on March 2020, as requested.

•   <strong>March 9 (Italy):</strong> Italy, the land of romance and slow driving, becomes Ground Zero for the plague. They managed to quarantine themselves so hard that even the pigeons started filing for divorce.

•   <strong>March 11 (WHO):</strong> The World Health Organization finally realizes there's a pandemic, like a toddler figuring out why the sky is blue. We were all doomed weeks ago, but thanks for the memo!

•   <strong>March 12 (US Stock Market):</strong> The stock market went into freefall faster than my dating life after college. Turns out, toilet paper hoarding is bad for the economy.

•   <strong>March 16 (US Stock Market):</strong> The market crashes even harder than your hopes and dreams. Black Monday got a sequel, and it was even shittier.

•   <strong>March 17 (EU):</strong> Europe closed its borders like a drunkard closing the bar at 2 AM. Too late, Europe, the virus has already ordered shots for the entire continent.

•   <strong>March 17 (UEFA &amp; CONMEBOL):</strong> The Euro and Copa América get postponed. Even sports knew when to call it quits. But hey, nothing like another year of whiny athletes to look forward to.

•   <strong>March 18 (Eurovision):</strong> Eurovision, the festival of garbage pop and cultural stereotypes, got canceled. It was a sign of the apocalypse.

•   <strong>March 24 (UK &amp; India):</strong> India and the UK go into lockdown. A third of the world's population is now facing restrictions. Congratulations, humanity. You managed to pull off a global mass panic with style!

•   <strong>March 24 (Japan &amp; Olympics):</strong> Japan and the IOC postpone the Olympics. At least they had a year to prepare for more delays, scandals, and overpriced merchandise.

•   <strong>March 27 (North Macedonia):</strong> North Macedonia joins NATO. Congrats, North Macedonia, your country now has all the problems of being a part of the organization. Have Fun!!!</div>
