  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest, 2010s-tinted take on these albums:

•   *<em>Björk - </em>Vespertine**<em>: 7/10. It's Björk, so it's weird and intriguing, but it's also kinda...static? It doesn't hit as hard as </em>Homogenic<em>, and a lot of the glitchy stuff feels a bit dated now that everyone's doing hyperpop.

•   </em><em>David Bowie - </em>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars<em><strong>: 9/10. Timeless. Still feels like the future even today. Everyone from Gaga to Arcade Fire owes something to this record. It's just such a cool and unique concept.

•   </strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor - </em>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven<em><strong>: 6/10. Okay, it's epic, I get it. But let's be real, how often are you REALLY in the mood for this? It's like the music equivalent of reading a Russian novel - impressive, but a chore.

•   </strong>Have a Nice Life - </em>Deathconsciousness<em><strong>: 8/10. Bleak and atmospheric, this album is the ultimate emo mood for late-night feels. Its got a strong cult following.

•   </strong>Jeff Buckley - </em>Grace<em><strong>: 9/10. Buckley's voice is just unreal. Every singer wishes they can hit those notes. Plus, "Hallelujah" is forever iconic, even if it's been covered to death.

•   </strong>Kendrick Lamar - </em>To Pimp a Butterfly<em><strong>: 10/10. This album is mandatory listening. It's complex, it's important, and it slaps. You don't just listen to it, you experience it.

•   </strong>King Crimson - </em>In the Court of the Crimson King<em><strong>: 5/10. I appreciate the ambition, but this is the kind of prog rock that gets made fun of. Mellotrons and fantasy lyrics? C'mon, guys.

•   </strong>Lauryn Hill - </em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill<em><strong>: 10/10. Still relevant, still powerful. She's spitting straight fire about love, society, and everything in between. She set a new standard.

•   </strong>Madvillain - </em>Madvillainy<em><strong>: 9/10. MF DOOM is a lyrical genius and Madlib's beats are perfect. It's weird, it's funky, it's endlessly replayable. It has some really hardcore fans

•   </strong>Marvin Gaye - </em>What's Going On<em><strong>: 10/10. Timeless. This album is as relevant now as it was back then. Marvin lays down some seriously uncomfortable truths about the state of the world, and it still hits hard.

•   </strong>Mingus - </em>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady<em><strong>: 7/10. Avant-garde jazz that can be challenging to get into. It's more of an academic exercise than something you'd casually throw on.

•   </strong>Nas - </em>Illmatic<em><strong>: 10/10. Lyrically dense, and the beats are gritty and raw. It's a snapshot of a specific time and place, and it's perfect.

•   </strong>Pink Floyd - </em>Wish You Were Here<em><strong>: 9/10. Still sounds amazing with headphones. Its a great record about loss.

•   </strong>Prince and the Revolution - </em>Purple Rain<em><strong>: 10/10. Just all-around amazing.

•   </strong>Radiohead - </em>In Rainbows<em><strong>: 9/10. Radiohead at their most accessible and emotional. The "pay-what-you-want" release was also a game-changer.

•   </strong>Stevie Wonder - </em>Songs in the Key of Life<em><strong>: 10/10. A masterclass in songwriting and musicianship. It's long, but every song is amazing. Stevie's on another level.

•   </strong>System of a Down - </em>Toxicity<em><strong>: 8/10. It's chaotic, it's aggressive, and it's impossible to ignore. You can't deny the sheer energy and originality of this band.

•   </strong>The Beatles - </em>Abbey Road<em><strong>: 9/10. It's the Beatles, so of course it's great. It's polished, it's experimental, and it's a perfect send-off to the greatest band of all time.

•   </strong>The Microphones - </em>The Glow, Pt. 2<em><strong>: 8/10. Lo-fi and intimate, this album creates a whole world of its own. It's like listening to someone's diary.

•   </strong>Wu-Tang Clan - </em>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)***: 10/10. The beats are hard, the rhymes are insane, and the whole vibe is just menacing. It's a game-changer.</div>
