  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of the Belarus National Team, position by position:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Fedor Lapoukhov (CSKA Sofia ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬):</strong> Playing in Bulgaria is not a sign of high quality. I'd rate him a <strong>4/10</strong>. Probably the best of a very bad bunch
â€¢   <strong>Pavel Pavlyuchenko (ML Vitebsk ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Playing locally is a bad sign and even worse when you're at ML Vitebsk. <strong>2/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Sergey Ignatovich (Zhenis ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Being at Zhenis is quite bad, it isn't the best club to be at. <strong>3/10</strong>

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Zakhar Volkov (ML Vitebsk ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Same as Pavlyuchenko. <strong>2/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Egor Parkhomenko (CSKA 1948 ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬):</strong> Again, Bulgaria not impressive. <strong>4/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Pavel Zabelin (Akritas Chlorakas ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Cyprus is a league for players in need of a career revival. <strong>3/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Aleksandr Martynovich (Kairat ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Okay, Kazakhstan league is meh, but he is experienced. <strong>5/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Vladislav Kalinin (Dinamo Minsk ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Local leagues aren't good enough. <strong>2/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Kirill Pechenin (Krylya Sovetov ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Russia... sketchy ethically and not exactly top football. <strong>5/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Vladislav Malkevich (Ural Yekaterinburg ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Same as above. <strong>5/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Vadim Pigas (Pari Nizhny Novgorod ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Ditto. <strong>5/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Sergey Karpovich (ML Vitebsk ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Useless player in a useless league. <strong>1/10</strong>

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Evgeniy Yablonskiy (Asteras Aktor ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·):</strong> Greece isn't that good. <strong>4/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Nikita Korzun (Aktobe ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Kazakhstan league. <strong>4/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Maksim Myakish (Dinamo Minsk ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Domestic league. <strong>2/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Max Ebong (Astana ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Kazakhstan again, <strong>4/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Yuriy Kovalev (Baltika ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Russia... <strong>5/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Valeriy Gromyko (Kairat ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Kazakhstan. <strong>4/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Nikita Demchenko (Dinamo Minsk ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> You know what I'm going to say <strong>2/10</strong>.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Roman Pasevich (Mura ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®):</strong> Slovenia is not competitive. <strong>4/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Evgeniy Malashevich (Dinamo Minsk ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Local league. <strong>2/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>Trofim Melnichenko (Porto B ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹):</strong> Second team, not great. <strong>4/10</strong>.
â€¢   <strong>German Barkovskiy (Piast Gliwice ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±):</strong> Poland is okay. <strong>5/10</strong>.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 2.5/10</strong>

This squad is horrific. The players are spread across obscure leagues, and even the ones in somewhat respectable leagues are not exactly tearing it up. There's a serious lack of quality and the team is incredibly weak. You'd be lucky if they can manage to win a match. It's a squad that screams mediocrity and struggles against any half-decent opposition. They are not going far in any competition and will probably get battered most games. They should consider sacking the manager and trying to bring in some youth to fix this awful team.</div>
