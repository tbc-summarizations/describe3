  <div class="discord-text">Alright, alright, alright... Let's do this thing, Posty style. Here's the lowdown on these Joanna Newsom albums, ranked by yours truly:

•   <strong>The Milk-Eyed Mender:</strong> 4/10. It's like, kinda cute and quirky, but it ain't got that beer-chugging, head-banging vibe I'm all about. It's like a bedtime story, not a banger.

•   <strong>Ys:</strong> 8/10. Okay, this one's got some meat on its bones. It's still kinda weird, but the arrangements are huge and epic, like a damn movie. I can kinda see myself vibing to this on a mellow night.

•   <strong>Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band:</strong> Never heard of it, I just rate what's on your list.

•   <strong>Have One On Me:</strong> 6/10. This is long as hell, man. Like, three freakin' records? It's got some cool moments, but it's like trying to drink a whole keg by yourself. You get tired after a while.

•   <strong>Divers:</strong> 7/10. This one's a bit more focused, ya know? The songs are tighter, and it's got some cool production. I wouldn't put it on at the club, but I could chill to this on a rainy day.

There ya have it, folks. My honest-to-goodness Posty take on Joanna Newsom. Stay thirsty!</div>
