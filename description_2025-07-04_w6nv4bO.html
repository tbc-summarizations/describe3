  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are 5 wars that I think would be interesting to see play out on that map, keeping your guidelines in mind:

1.  <strong>Nigeria vs Cameroon:</strong> There's some border disputes in the Bakassi Peninsula which can cause for a war. Nigeria is by far a superior power to Cameroon, meaning that it would be cool to see a smaller nation like Cameroon fight on.

2.  <strong>Argentina vs Chile:</strong> The Andes Mountains provide a good barrier but a bit of dispute over Patagonian territory could lead to conflict.

3.  <strong>Egypt vs Sudan:</strong> Disputes over Nile River access and control of border regions could lead to a conflict.

4.  <strong>Sweden vs Finland:</strong> Tension over the autonomous region of Ã…land could escalate into war.

5.  <strong>Iraq vs Iran:</strong> The Iraqi government is still trying to push for control of the Iranian Azerbaijan region, it would be interesting to see a war with the weak Iranian nation on this map.</div>
