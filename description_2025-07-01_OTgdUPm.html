  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal truth about these Champions League semi-final results:

<strong>Juventus vs. Barcelona:</strong> Juventus actually managed to draw in Barcelona, who are known for their dominance at home, it is quite unexpected. But they absolutely bottled it at home. Losing to Barcelona at home after drawing away?! Unforgivable. The old lady crumbled under pressure. Barcelona gets to move on, but they should know they were lucky.

<strong>Manchester United vs. Arsenal:</strong> Manchester United, who are the biggest club, managed to win the game quite well. But Arsenal, oh Arsenal, a team that just cannot get it right. Losing 2-0 at home and only managing a 3-2 victory back at home? Absolutely pathetic. You had one job, Arsenal, and you failed miserably. The fans have every right to be furious. What a waste of talent. At least, United did not make the mistake that Juventus did. Arsenal is just not good enough and should be ashamed of their performance. A truly disastrous showing.</div>
