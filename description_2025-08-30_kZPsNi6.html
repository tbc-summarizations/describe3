  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of that Pafos lineup:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Jay Gorter:</strong> 6/10 - Promising talent, but can be prone to errors at times. Needs to command his area better. Potential to improve.
•   <strong>Bruno Langa:</strong> 6.5/10 - Decent going forward, but can be suspect defensively. Needs to be more disciplined and aware of his positioning.
•   <strong>Derrick Luckassen:</strong> 7/10 - Solid, experienced defender. Brings a physical presence to the backline and is good in the air. Can be a bit slow at times.
•   <strong>David Goldar:</strong> 6/10 - Reliable, but not spectacular. Consistent performer who rarely makes mistakes. Lacks the athleticism to dominate.
•   <strong>Bruno:</strong> 5/10 - Needs a lot of improvement and not at all a dependable player.
•   <strong>Pêpê:</strong> 7.5/10 - Dynamic midfielder with a good engine. Can break up play and contribute in attack. Needs to improve his decision-making in the final third.
•   <strong>Vlad Dragomir:</strong> 6/10 - Technically gifted player with a good passing range. Lacks the physicality and work rate to be a top-class midfielder. Needs to be more consistent.
•   <strong>Ivan Sunjic:</strong> 7/10 - A solid midfield presence who is great defensively and has a great passing range.
•   <strong>Mislav Orsic:</strong> 7/10 - Experienced player with an eye for goal. Can be a threat cutting in from the wing. Lacks pace and stamina.
•   <strong>Anderson Silva:</strong> 5/10 - Not as good or well known, but still shows potential.
•   <strong>Muamer Tankovic:</strong> 7/10 - Talented forward who knows how to score.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

5/10.

This Pafos XI has potential but is far from perfect. It has experienced and inexperienced players. There are significant defensive liabilities that need to be addressed for the team to be truly competitive. Offensively, the team can create chances, but needs to be more clinical in front of goal.</div>
