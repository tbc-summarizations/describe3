  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's how these Champions League quarter-finals are <em>really</em> going down:

<strong>Paris Saint-Germain vs. Juventus:</strong>

•   <strong>1st Leg (Paris):</strong> PSG 4 - 0 Juventus. Look, I'm not saying Juventus are washed up, but they are. PSG's attack of Mbappe and Neymar will embarrass Juventus's defense. It's going to be a bloodbath from the start, and Juve's midfield will be non-existent.
•   <strong>2nd Leg (Turin):</strong> Juventus 1 - 2 PSG. Juve manages a consolation goal at home, but they are still terrible. PSG just toys with them, knowing the tie is over. The Juventus faithful will be leaving early, booing their own team.

<strong>Aggregate: PSG 6 - 1 Juventus</strong>. Juventus is simply not on the same level as PSG. This tie will be over quickly and painfully for the Italians.

<strong>Barcelona vs. Lyon:</strong>

•   <strong>1st Leg (Barcelona):</strong> Barcelona 5 - 1 Lyon. Lyon is a club for jokes. Barcelona are still great. Messi will run riot. Lyon's defense won't know what hit them. The only reason Lyon scores is because Barcelona get complacent.
•   <strong>2nd Leg (Lyon):</strong> Lyon 2 - 3 Barcelona. Playing at home will give Lyon a little bit of an advantage, but Barcelona have what it takes to be better, and they will dominate Lyon.

<strong>Aggregate: Barcelona 8 - 3 Lyon</strong>. Lyon is completely outclassed. This is a mismatch of epic proportions.

<strong>Manchester United vs. Galatasaray:</strong>

•   <strong>1st Leg (Manchester):</strong> Manchester United 1 - 0 Galatasaray. It'll be a tighter game than people expect. United have moments of brilliance, but Galatasaray will be too good for them. United get a lucky goal late in the game after Galatasaray missed many chances.
•   <strong>2nd Leg (Istanbul):</strong> Galatasaray 2 - 1 Manchester United. Galatasaray turns it on at home. The atmosphere is insane, and they get two goals, but United manage to score one to make it close at the end.

<strong>Aggregate: Galatasaray 2 - 2 Manchester United. Galatasaray win on away goals</strong> United doesn't have what it takes to be Champions League Quarter-Finalists.

<strong>Arsenal vs. Valencia:</strong>

•   <strong>1st Leg (London):</strong> Arsenal 0 - 2 Valencia. Arsenal have become a shadow of themselves and are not what they used to be. They are going to face a tough team, the atmosphere and lack of skill will cost Arsenal.
•   <strong>2nd Leg (Valencia):</strong> Valencia 3 - 1 Arsenal. Valencia is a better team. Arsenal will be desperate, but their defense will be a mess. It'll be a painful and embarrassing exit for Arsenal.

<strong>Aggregate: Valencia 5 - 1 Arsenal</strong>. Arsenal doesn't have the quality or the leadership to even compete against a Valencia team. This is where their Champions League journey ends.</div>
