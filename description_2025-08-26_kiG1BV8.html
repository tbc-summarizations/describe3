  <div class="discord-text">Alright, picture it: the 90s. Grunge is king, hip-hop is blowing up, and the internet is just a weird thing for nerds. Here's how I'd rate those albums back then:

•   <strong>Björk - Vespertine:</strong> (Out in 2001 but let's imagine!) Four stars. Weird, but kinda cool. Iceland chick is definitely doing her own thing. Not exactly mainstream, but those artsy types would dig it.

•   <strong>David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars:</strong> Five stars, duh. This came out way before the 90s, but it's a classic. Still sounds fresh, even if my older brother stole my vinyl copy.

•   <strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven:</strong> (Out in 2000) Two stars. What in the actual hell is this? Sounds like a bunch of noise. Maybe if I was super stoned at a rave, I'd get it. Hard pass.

•   <strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> (Out in 2008) One star. Emo garbage. Go cut yourself somewhere else. This is a mood killer.

•   <strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> Four stars. This guy has got some serious pipes. "Hallelujah" gives me chills. Shame about what happened to him.

•   <strong>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> (Out in 2015) Two stars. Mumbling is not rapping. What happened to the 90s rap?

•   <strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King:</strong> Three stars. Okay, this is kinda interesting. Prog rock is weird, but this has some killer guitar riffs. Dad would like it.

•   <strong>Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:</strong> Five stars. YES! This is the real deal. Smart, soulful, and she can rap AND sing. This album is going to be HUGE.

•   <strong>Madvillain - Madvillainy:</strong> (Out in 2004) One star. What even is this? Is this rap? Why does he sound like he's talking underwater?

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye - What's Going On:</strong> Five stars. This is timeless. Even my mom loves this one. Makes you think about the world.

•   <strong>Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady:</strong> Three stars. Jazz is okay, but this is a bit much. Some cool sounds though.

•   <strong>Nas - Illmatic:</strong> Five stars. BOOM! This is what hip-hop is all about. Hard beats, real lyrics. Straight outta Queensbridge.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here:</strong> Five stars. Another classic. Perfect for chilling out and getting lost in your thoughts.

•   <strong>Prince and the Revolution - Purple Rain:</strong> Five stars. Prince is a god. The soundtrack is killer. The movie is a bit cheesy, but who cares?

•   <strong>Radiohead - In Rainbows:</strong> (Out in 2007) One star. It's just too weird and experimental.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life:</strong> Five stars. Stevie is a genius. So many great songs on this album. Makes you feel good.

•   <strong>System of a Down - Toxicity:</strong> (Out in 2001) Three stars. Heavy but repetitive. Not that amazing.

•   <strong>The Beatles - Abbey Road:</strong> Five stars. Timeless, classic, essential. End of story.

•   <strong>The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> (Out in 2001) One star. Super depressing.

•   <strong>Wu-Tang Clan - Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers):</strong> Five stars. Wu-Tang ain't nothin' to f\<em>\</em>k with! This album changed the game. Raw, gritty, and unforgettable.

There you have it. My brutally honest takes from the perspective of a 90s music listener.</div>
