  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal breakdown of these Europa League qualifying matches, no holds barred:

•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk 6-0 Ilves:</strong> Ilves, you got absolutely slaughtered. You came into this tie thinking you had a chance? Pathetic. Shakhtar showed you exactly where you belong – back in Finland, dreaming of ever competing at this level.

•   <strong>Sheriff Tiraspol 5-2 Prishtina:</strong> Sheriff, not bad. You put away Prishtina, but frankly, it should have been more dominant. Prishtina, go home.

•   <strong>Spartak Trnava 2-3 Häcken:</strong> Trnava, choked. You were at home, and you let a Swedish team come in and steal your glory. Häcken, well done on the smash and grab.

•   <strong>Sabah 5-6 Celje:</strong> Sabah, what a collapse! Scoring 5 goals should be enough to win a tie against Celje. Absolutely pathetic.

•   <strong>Legia Warsaw 2-0 Aktobe:</strong> Legia, boring. You did what you were supposed to do, but without any flair. Aktobe, you were never going to win this one, were you?

•   <strong>Levski Sofia 1-1 Hapoel Be'er Sheva (Levski wins 3-1 on penalties):</strong> Levski, penalties are a lottery, but you had more composure. Hapoel, missing three penalties? You should be ashamed of yourselves.

•   <strong>AEK Larnaca 2-2 Partizan (Larnaca wins 6-5 on penalties):</strong> AEK, another penalty shootout win! You showed some steel to put away Partizan, who really should have buried you.

•   <strong>Paks 0-3 CFR Cluj:</strong> Paks, you were never in this. CFR Cluj, you made easy work of a team who really don't know how to defend. Pathetic showing by Paks.</div>
