  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic excuse for a UEFA Nations League D group.

<strong>Moldova:</strong> Congrats on the promotion, I guess. Barely scraping by with 5 goals scored is hardly inspiring. You managed to beat teams that couldn't score to save their lives, so don't get too cocky heading into League C. You'll get slaughtered there.

<strong>Malta:</strong> Qualification for the promotion play-offs with a whopping 2 goals scored in 4 games? Seriously? You're a disgrace to the sport. Good luck in the play-offs; you'll need more than luck when you're allergic to scoring goals.

<strong>Andorra:</strong> Oh, Andorra, you absolute garbage heap of a football team. Zero goals scored? Are you even trying? A single point from a draw is the only thing keeping you from being the laughingstock of the entire competition, which is impressive in its own right. Enjoy rotting away in League D; you clearly belong there.

<strong>Matchday Commentary:</strong>

•   <strong>Matchday 1:</strong> Moldova beats Malta 2-0. Wow, Moldova, congrats on beating another team that can't score. Andorra loses 1-0, confirming our suspicions that they are, in fact, incapable of putting the ball in the net.
•   <strong>Matchday 2:</strong> Moldova defeats Andorra 2-0. Color me shocked. Malta manages to squeak out a 1-0 win against Moldova. That makes zero sense. I don't understand. I'd bet it was luck.
•   <strong>Matchday 3:</strong> Andorra can't score, losing 0-1 to Moldova. It keeps being brought up because I still can't believe a team can't score. I'm pretty sure Andorra are the first people to get paid to miss. Malta and Andorra engage in a scoreless draw. This match must have been excruciatingly boring to watch. Honestly, if I were there, I would probably just leave.

In summary, this group is an embarrassment to football. The teams are terrible, the games are boring, and the fact that any of them are being promoted is a slap in the face to more competent teams in other leagues.</div>
