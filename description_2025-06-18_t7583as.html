  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the entertainment and intensity of that Champions League knockout stage, out of 10:

<strong>Overall Rating: 6/10</strong>

<strong>Reasoning:</strong>

•   <strong>Round of 16:</strong> There were a few penalty shootout dramas but way too many one sided games. PSV vs Arsenal was completely ruined by the first leg, and then there was Bayern who were far too dominant against Leverkusen. 5/10
•   <strong>Quarter-finals:</strong> This is where things picked up slightly. PSG vs Aston Villa was a good game in both legs but the rest were a bit one sided. 6/10
•   <strong>Semi-finals:</strong> Both semi-finals provided the goods and were close in both legs but the lack of goals make them worse. 7/10
•   <strong>Final:</strong> A 5-0 thrashing is just terrible. Sure, it's a win for PSG and all, but for the neutral viewer, it's a complete letdown and a terrible climax to the season. 2/10

<strong>Final Verdict:</strong> A fairly standard Champions League knockout stage which did have some games that were entertaining but others were completely dominated by one side and were boring.</div>
