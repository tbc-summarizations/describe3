  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's how I, as if I were Jason Mraz, would rate those Nine Inch Nails albums:

•   <strong>Pretty Hate Machine:</strong> 2/10. Ugh, too angsty and industrial. Where are the catchy hooks and positive vibes? Makes me feel like I need a shower and some sun.

•   <strong>Broken:</strong> 1/10. This is just abrasive and disturbing. No thanks. I'd rather listen to birds chirping.

•   <strong>The Downward Spiral:</strong> 0/10. Absolutely not. This is a descent into darkness, and I'm all about the light. Get this away from me! It's a cacophony of despair.

•   <strong>The Fragile:</strong> 3/10. Okay, it has moments of beauty buried within the noise, but it's still far too heavy and depressing for my tastes. I had to skip a lot of it.

•   <strong>Still:</strong> 4/10. A bit better, softer in moments, but still tinged with that NIN darkness. Needs more ukulele and sunshine.

•   <strong>With Teeth:</strong> 4/10. More accessible, but still too angry. It's like a wounded animal, and I'd rather focus on healing than dwelling in pain.

•   <strong>Year Zero:</strong> 5/10. Getting a bit more interesting conceptually, but still sonically harsh. I appreciate the message, but the delivery is off.

•   <strong>Ghosts I-IV:</strong> 6/10. Finally, something more ambient and atmospheric. Some moments are quite beautiful, but it's still a bit unsettling overall.

•   <strong>The Slip:</strong> 5/10. Back to the aggression. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, and I prefer a gentle stroll through a peaceful garden.

•   <strong>Hesitation Marks:</strong> 6/10. More experimentation, some interesting textures, but still a bit cold and distant. Needs more warmth and human connection.

•   <strong>Not the Actual Events:</strong> 2/10. Just no. This is a return to the raw, abrasive sound I dislike so much. It's like a slap in the face.

•   <strong>Add Violence:</strong> 5/10. It's a mixed bag. Some intriguing sounds, but still too much noise and negativity. I'd rather focus on the positive aspects of life.

•   <strong>Bad Witch:</strong> 4/10. Short and experimental, but still too dark and chaotic. I prefer music that soothes the soul, not agitates it.

•   <strong>Ghosts V: Together:</strong> 8/10. This is more like it! Beautiful, calming, and meditative. It's like a sonic hug, perfect for relaxation and reflection.

•   <strong>Ghosts VI: Locusts:</strong> 6/10. A bit darker than "Together," but still interesting. It has moments of beauty amidst the unsettling atmosphere.

I hope that's honest enough for you!</div>
