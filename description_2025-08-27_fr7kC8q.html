  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down Kairat Almaty's Champions League qualifying run. I'll give you my overall rating and then individual round assessments, no sugarcoating:

<strong>Overall Rating: 7/10</strong>

They got the job done, but it wasn't always pretty. They showed grit and determination to grind out results, especially in those penalty shootouts. However, they were far from dominant and relied heavily on luck at times.

<strong>Individual Round Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>First Round vs. Olimpija Ljubljana:</strong> 6/10. A shaky away draw followed by a comfortable home win. Not convincing, but they got through.
•   <strong>Second Round vs. KuPS:</strong> 8/10. A terrible first leg performance, but they showed excellent character to bounce back with a dominant home win and secure a place in the next round.
•   <strong>Third Round vs. Slovan Bratislava:</strong> 7/10. Grinding out a result at home followed by a tense penalty shootout victory. Pure survival football.
•   <strong>Play-off Round vs. Celtic:</strong> 9/10. Absolute defensive masterclass and penalty shootout heroics. They were the underdogs and played like it, frustrating Celtic and snatching the win in the shootout.

<strong>Match Records Analysis:</strong>

•   3 wins, 3 draws, 2 losses: Shows they weren't dominant, but difficult to beat.
•   7 goals scored, 4 goals conceded: Tight defense was their strength, but the attack lacked firepower.

<strong>Final Verdict:</strong>

Kairat's run was a mix of luck, resilience, and some tactical nous. They weren't the most impressive team, but they had the mental fortitude to navigate the tough qualifying rounds and secure their place in the Champions League.</div>
