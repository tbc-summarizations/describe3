  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because I'm not holding back:

<strong>Individual Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Cláudio Taffarel:</strong> 6/10 - Decent shot-stopper, but prone to the occasional blunder. Not a commanding presence, more reactive than proactive. Very average.

•   <strong>Jorginho:</strong> 5/10 - Solid defensively, but offered next to nothing going forward. Lacked the pace and creativity needed from a modern fullback. Was a passenger in this team.

•   <strong>Aldair:</strong> 7/10 - A rock at the back. Strong in the tackle, good in the air, and rarely put a foot wrong. One of the better players in this XI. Not great.

•   <strong>Márcio Santos:</strong> 5/10 - Inconsistent and prone to errors. His penalty shootout miss nearly cost Brazil the title. Got lucky with a better team around him.

•   <strong>Branco:</strong> 6/10 - Experienced and a threat from set-pieces, but defensively suspect. Too slow and often caught out of position. Not a liability but below standard.

•   <strong>Mazinho:</strong> 5/10 - Industrious but lacking in quality. A workhorse but not a game-changer. Overrated

•   <strong>Mauro Silva:</strong> 7/10 - A defensive stalwart. Broke up play effectively and provided a shield for the back four. Underrated but not exceptional.

•   <strong>Dunga:</strong> 6/10 - The captain. Combative and vocal but limited technically. More grit than guile.

•   <strong>Zinho:</strong> 5/10 - Another workmanlike midfielder. Offered little in the way of creativity or attacking threat. Just there to fill a spot. Mediocre.

•   <strong>Bebeto:</strong> 8/10 - A clever and clinical finisher. Formed a lethal partnership with Romário. One of the few genuinely world-class players in the team.

•   <strong>Romário:</strong> 9/10 - The star of the show. A magician with the ball at his feet and a deadly finisher. Carried Brazil to the title.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>Overall: 6/10</strong>

Harsh, maybe, but this Brazil team was functional rather than spectacular. They were defensively solid, but lacked flair and creativity in midfield. They relied heavily on the brilliance of Romário and Bebeto to score goals, and were often fortunate to get results. Compared to other great Brazil teams, this one was distinctly average, and won due to luck and individual brilliance rather than team cohesion or tactical superiority. They ground out results but were far from a vintage side.</div>
