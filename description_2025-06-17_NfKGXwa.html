  <h1>Description for image.png, image.png, image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on the images and your requirements for wheelies on an electric scooter, especially to avoid burning your hands, here's my brutally honest take:

<strong>Pro Taper Pillow Top Grips (Image 1)</strong>

•   <strong>Pros:</strong> These grips are specifically designed for comfort. The "pillow top" design suggests better vibration absorption, which will reduce the strain on your hands when pulling hard for wheelies. The textured surface will also provide a good grip, minimizing the chances of your hands slipping.
•   <strong>Cons:</strong> The large Pro Taper logo could wear down over time, and the raised lettering might create hotspots on your hand.

<strong>Grips with Raised Blocks (Images 2 &amp; 3)</strong>

•   <strong>Pros:</strong> The raised block design might offer a very secure grip. They could also be more durable in general.
•   <strong>Cons:</strong> These grips look like they would offer less in the way of vibration dampening and cushion.

<strong>Recommendation:</strong>

If you want to minimize burning in the hand, especially during repetitive motions like wheelies, I'd lean towards the <strong>Pro Taper Pillow Top Grips (Image 1)</strong> due to their focus on comfort and vibration absorption. I'd personally want to test how the logo impacts the grip.</div>
