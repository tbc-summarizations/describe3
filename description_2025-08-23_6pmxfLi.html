  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this potential US vs. Canada matchup. 

<strong>Predicted Scoreline: United States 3 - Canada 1</strong>

Here's the brutal honesty behind my assessment:

•   <strong>United States Advantage:</strong> The US has a clear edge in midfield and attack. Tyler Adams provides a defensive shield that Canada lacks, while the creative trio of Tillman, Pulisic, and the finishing of Balogun will be a nightmare for the Canadian defense.
•   <strong>Canada's Weaknesses Exposed:</strong> Canada's defense is questionable. The United States will easily be able to dribble around them as they don't have the speed to keep up. In midfield, Canada is a huge step down compared to the United States and their attack is very uninspiring outside of David.

<strong>Detailed Breakdown:</strong>

•   <strong>United States Offense:</strong> Pulisic, even if not in peak form, can still deliver moments of brilliance. Folarin Balogun brings a clinical edge upfront. Canada's defense will be constantly stretched, creating opportunities for cutbacks and through balls.
•   <strong>United States Defense:</strong> While not impenetrable, the US backline is solid. Canada's attack is lackluster outside of Jonathan David.
•   <strong>Canada's Attack:</strong> David is isolated. Shaffelburg and Buchanan are inconsistent.

The US wins pretty handily.</div>
