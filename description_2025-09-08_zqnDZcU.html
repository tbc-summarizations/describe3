  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these quarter-final results with some brutal honesty:

•   <strong>Italy 6-1 Sweden:</strong> Italy absolutely decimated Sweden! Sweden, what was that pathetic excuse for a defense? Did you guys even show up to the match? Italy, you played like champions, keep that momentum going!

•   <strong>Portugal 3-1 England:</strong> Portugal took down England. England, you're a disgrace to the football world! Another tournament, another failure. You choked when it mattered most. Portugal, congratulations on exposing England's lack of talent and weak mentality!

•   <strong>Spain 4-2 Norway:</strong> Spain dominated Norway. Norway, you put up a decent fight, but in the end, you were simply outclassed. Spain, good job on securing the victory, now go on and win it all!

•   <strong>France 3-2 Serbia:</strong> France barely scraped by against Serbia. Serbia, you almost pulled off the upset, but close only counts in horseshoes. France, you need to step up your game if you want to go any further in this tournament. That performance was almost embarrassing.</div>
