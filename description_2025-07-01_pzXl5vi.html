  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of this Champions League "dream team":

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10)</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper: Altay Bayindir (Manchester United) - 4/10:</strong> Hasn't proven himself in the premier league.

•   <strong>Defender: Ruben Dias (Manchester City) - 8/10:</strong> A top-tier defender, commanding presence, and excellent leadership. Worthy of a high rating.

•   <strong>Defender: Pau Cubarsi (Barcelona) - 6/10:</strong> A promising talent, but far from a finished product. Still has areas to improve defensively.

•   <strong>Defender: William Saliba (Arsenal) - 7/10:</strong> Has the potential to be one of the best.

•   <strong>Defender: Tsuyoshi Watanabe (Gent) - 3/10:</strong> Playing in the Belgian league doesn't exactly scream "Champions League elite". Likely a weak link.

•   <strong>Midfielder: Pedri (Barcelona) - 7/10:</strong> A technically gifted player, with some world-class moments.

•   <strong>Midfielder: Mason Mount (Manchester United) - 5/10:</strong> Overrated and underwhelming.

•   <strong>Midfielder: Pablo Torre (Barcelona) - 4/10:</strong> Young and unproven. Jury is still out on his potential.

•   <strong>Midfielder: Martin Odegaard (Arsenal) - 7/10:</strong> Creative and technically gifted.

•   <strong>Attacker: Raphinha (Barcelona) - 6/10:</strong> Flashes of brilliance mixed with inconsistency. Can be frustrating to watch.

•   <strong>Attacker: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United) - 5/10:</strong> Raw potential, but massively unpolished.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5/10</strong>

This team is a mess and would get absolutely demolished. There are some decent players in there, but the team has massive holes and glaring weaknesses:

•   <strong>Defensively Suspect:</strong> The defense is a major concern. The combination of a weak goalkeeper and an unproven defender will leak goals left and right. Dias is the only reliable presence, but he can't do it all alone.
•   <strong>Midfield Imbalance:</strong> The midfield lacks a true defensive presence and is too heavily reliant on creative players. They would get overrun by any team with a strong, physical midfield.
•   <strong>Attack Lacks Bite:</strong> The attack is toothless. This is not a strike force that will strike fear into the hearts of opponents.

In short, this team is a collection of overhyped players who would struggle to make it out of the group stages in the Champions League. They'd probably get humiliated by a well-organized team with a clear tactical plan. This team is more of a laughing stock than a legitimate contender.</div>
