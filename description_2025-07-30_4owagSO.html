  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to be a verbal bloodbath:

<strong>Setting:</strong> A grimy bathroom. A fat pigeon and a fat chicken sit on toilets facing each other, a chessboard precariously balanced between them.

<strong>Pigeon:</strong> (Eyes the chicken with disdain) Well, well, look what the cat dragged in. Or rather, what the farmer failed to slaughter. Still laying those pathetic little excuses for eggs, Clucky? I bet they're as bland and tasteless as your personality.

<strong>Chicken:</strong> (Squawks indignantly) At least my eggs are good for something, you filthy sky rat! What are you good for besides crapping on statues and spreading diseases? You're basically a feathered parasite. And look at that pathetic excuse for a body! You're so fat you look like you swallowed a basketball.

<strong>Pigeon:</strong> Fat? This is prime pigeon muscle, you ignorant clucker! I bet you can't even fly anymore, waddling around like a deformed potato. And that comb! What is that, a disfigured tomato glued to your head? You look like a clown threw up on you.

<strong>Chicken:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings, you overgrown gutter snipe? At least I have a purpose! People eat me, you know? What do they do with you? Shove you off a building for target practice? I bet your family tree is a straight line, you inbred pigeon.

<strong>Pigeon:</strong> Inbred? Coming from the bird whose ancestors were probably the first victims of KFC? At least pigeons have class. You're just a glorified McNugget waiting to happen. And speaking of family trees, I bet yours looks like a chicken coop explosion!

<strong>Chicken:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of your incessant cooing! It's like listening to nails on a chalkboard. And that beak! It's so dull, you probably couldn't peck your way out of a wet paper bag.

<strong>Pigeon:</strong> Dull beak? I'll show you dull! (Reaches across the chessboard, knocking over the pieces) I've had enough of your poultry insults!

<strong>Chicken:</strong> Bring it on, you flying turd! I'll pluck your feathers one by one!

<strong>(The pigeon leaps off the toilet, flapping its wings wildly and scattering toilet paper. The chicken squawks and lunges, feathers flying. A chaotic brawl ensues, filled with pecks, wing slaps, and indignant squawks and coos. The bathroom is a disaster zone.)</strong></div>
