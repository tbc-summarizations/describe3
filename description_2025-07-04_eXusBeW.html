  <div class="discord-text">Based on Diogo Jota's club stats, achievements, and the clubs he represented, I'd give his total career a solid <strong>7/10</strong>. He was a great player but definitely not a legend of the game.

Here's my reasoning:

•   <strong>Positive Aspects:</strong>
•   He played for top clubs like Porto, Wolverhampton, and Liverpool, showing consistent quality.
•   His goal and assist contributions were respectable for a forward, particularly in the Premier League.
•   He won important trophies, including the Premier League and domestic cups with Liverpool.
•   He made a mark on the international stage with Portugal, winning the UEFA Nations League twice.

•   <strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong>
•   While his stats are good, they don't reach the elite level that would put him in the 8-10 range.
•   He wasn't a consistent starter or superstar at Liverpool, often sharing playing time with other talented forwards.
•   He didn't win major European trophies like the Champions League or Europa League.
•   His career was relatively short, ending at age 28.</div>
